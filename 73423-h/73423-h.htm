As your Society even
<i>ab origine</i> hath deservedly
acquired an
eminency in many
respects above others
of this kind; so more especially
for the pregnancy of its
Members in the composing of
<i>Peals</i>. For when the Art of
<i>Cross-pricking</i> lay enveloped in
such obscurity, that it was
thought impossible that double
Changes on five bells could be
made to extend farther than <i>ten</i>,
and triple and double Changes
on six farther than <i>sixty</i>;
then it was that a worthy
and knowing Member of your
Society, to dissipate those mists
of Ignorance, and to usher in
the bright morn of Knowledg,
prickt those much applauded
Peals of <i>Grandsire</i> and <i>Grandsire
Bob</i>; which for their excellency
have for many years together
continued triumphant in practice
amidst all others whatsoever;
and which indeed have been a
great light in the production of
that great variety of new Peals
herein contained; the greatest
part of which being also the offspring
of your Society, I therefore
thought fit to usher them
into the world under the wings
of your Protection.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Gentlemen</i>, as a member I held
my self obliged to add my Mite
to your full fraught Treasury of
Speculative and Practical Knowledg
of this kind; though I confess
your acquisition on this account
will be very mean, since
my want of ability sufficient to
undertake a thing of this nature,
and also want of opportunity
by converse with others to supply
my own defects, have rendred
the Book less acceptable
than it might have been done by
some more knowing head and
acuter Pen. And although I
am conscious that it meriteth
not your acceptance; yet I assume
the confidence to believe
that you will favour it with a
kind entertainment amongst
you; and the rather, for that I
know you are too judicious to
sentence it without first casting
into the ballance of your indifferent
judgments some Grains of

These clear dayes of Knowledge,
that have ransackt
the dark corners of most
Arts and Sciences, and
freed their hidden mysteries
from the bonds of obscurity,
have also registred this of <i>Ringing</i>,
in the Catalogue of their Improvements;
as well the Speculative as the Practick part,
which of late years remain’d in <i>Embryo</i>, are
now become perfect, and worthy the knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>of the most ingenious. Although the
Practick part of <i>Ringing</i> is chiefly the subject
of this Discourse, yet first I will speak something
of the Art of <i>Changes</i>, its Invention being
Mathematical, and produceth incredible
effects, as hereafter will appear. But first,
I will premise a word or two, to shew what
the nature of those <i>Changes</i> are. Some certain
number of things are presupposed to be
changed or varied; as 2.3.4.5.6. or any
greater number whatsoever; then the number
of things to be so varied must have the
like number of fixed places assigned them. As
if five men were sitting upon five stools in a
row; the stools are supposed to be fixed
places for the five men, but the men by consent
may move or change to each others places
at pleasure, yet still sitting in a row as at
first: now this Art directs how, and in what
order those five men may change places with
each other, whereby they may sit sixscore
times in a row, and not twice alike. And
likewise a <i>Peal</i> of five Bells, being raised up
to a fit compass for ringing of <i>Changes</i>, are
there supposed to have five fixed places,
which time assigns to their notes or strokes;
yet the notes of the Bells may change into
each others places at pleasure: now this Art
also directs the manner and method of changing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>the five notes in such sort, that they
may strike sixscore times round, and not
twice alike.</p>

<p class='c006'>The numbers of <i>Changes</i> are thus to be
discovered. <i>Two</i> must first be admitted to
be varied two wayes; then to find out the
Changes in <i>three</i>, the Changes on two must
be multiplied by three, and the product will
be six, which are the compleat number of
Changes on three.</p>

<p class='c006'>Those six Changes being multiplied by
four, will produce 24, which are the compleat
number of Changes on four. The 24
Changes on four, being multiplied by five,
will produce 120, which are the compleat
number of Changes on five. And in like
manner the 120, being multiplied by six,
will produce 720, which are the compleat
number on six. The 720, being multiplied,
by seven, will produce 5040, which are the
number of Changes on seven. The 5040,
being multiplied by eight, will produce
40320, which are the number of Changes on
eight. Those Changes on eight, being multiplied
by nine, will produce 362880, which
are the number of Changes on nine. Those
Changes on nine, being multiplied by ten,
will produce 3628800, which are the number
on ten. Those on ten, being multiplied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>by eleven, will produce 39916800, which
are the number on eleven. Those also being
multiplied by twelve, will produce
479001600, which are the compleat number
of Changes on twelve. And if twelve
men should attempt to ring all those Changes
on twelve Bells, they could not effect it
in less than seventy five years, twelve Lunar
Months, one week, and three days, notwithstanding
they ring without intermission, and
after the proportion of 720 Changes every
hour. Or if one man should attempt to
prick them down upon Paper, he could not effect
it in less than the aforesaid space. And
1440 being prickt in a sheet, they would
take up six hundred sixty five Reams of Paper,
and upwards, reckoning five hundred
Sheets to a Ream; which Paper at five shillings
the Ream, would cost one hundred sixty
six Pounds five Shillings,</p>

<p class='c006'>The reason of the aforesaid Multiplication,
by which the numbers of Changes are discovered,
and also that those Products are the
true numbers of Changes, will plainly and
manifestly appear in these following Demonstrations.</p>

<p class='c006'>But first, <i>two</i> must be admitted to be varied
two ways, thus.——</p>

<table class='table0'>
  <tr>
 <td class='blt c008'>12</td>
    <td class='c008'>&#160;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
 <td class='blt c008'>21</td>
    <td class='c008'>&#160;</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c006'>And then consequently, <i>three</i> will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>make three times as many Changes as <i>two</i>;
for there are three times two figures to be
produced out of three, and not twice two
the same figures, which are to be produced
by casting away each of the three figures
one after another.
First, cast away
3, and 1.2 will, remain; cast away
2, and 1.3 will remain; cast away 1, and
2.3 will remain. So that here are three
times two figures produced out of the
three, and not twice two the same figures,
as 12. 13. 23. each two may be varied
two ways, as before: then to the changes
which each two makes add the third figure
which is wanting; as to the two changes
made by 1.2 add the 3, to the changes on
1.3 add the 2, and to the changes on 2.3 add
the 1, and the three figures will stand six
times together, and not twice alike, as here
appeareth.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Four</i> will make four times as many
changes as <i>three</i>. For there are four
times three figures to be had out of
four, and not twice three the same figures,
which are to be produced by
casting away each of the four figures
by turns. First cast away 4, and 123
will remain; cast away 3, and 124
will remain; cast away 2, and 134
will remain; and lastly, casting away
1, and 234 will remain; so that here
is 123, 124, 134, 234, and not twice
three the same figures. Now each
three may be varied six ways, according
to the preceding Example. Then
to the six changes which each three
makes, add the fourth figure which is
wanting; as to the six changes on 123
add the 4, to the six changes on 124
add the 3, to the six changes on 134
add the 2, and to the six changes on
234 add the 1, which renders the changes
compleat; for then the four figures stand
twenty four times together, and not twice
alike, as here appears.</p>

that is 120 times, wherein it maketh
120 times six changes, which amounts to
720. And in like manner the figure 7 hunts
720 times through 123456, wherein it maketh
720 times seven changes, which amounts
to 5040. The eighth hunteth 5040 times
through 1234567, wherein it makes 40320
changes. The 9<sup>th</sup> hunteth 40320 times through
12345678, wherein it makes 362880 changes.
The tenth hunteth 362880 times
through 123456789, wherein it makes
3628800. The eleventh hunteth 3628800
times through 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10. wherein
it makes 39916800. And lastly, the twelfth
hunteth 39916800 times through 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.11.
wherein it makes 39916800
times twelve changes, which  amounts to
479001600, being the compleat number on
twelve. By which ’tis evident, that every
hunting figure hunts as many times through
its assigned number of figures, as those figures
are capable of making changes, which in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>short comprehends the summe and substance
of this method, which is universal from two,
to all greater numbers whatsoever.</p>

<p class='c006'>If we consider the multitude of different
words, wherewith we express our selves in
Speech, it may be thought almost impossible
that such numbers should arise out of twenty
four Letters; yet this Art of variation will
produce much more incredible effects. To
give an instance thereof, I will shew the numbers
of every quantity of Letters from two
to twelve, that may be produced out of the
Alphabet. The generality of Words consisting
of these quantities, (<i>viz.</i>) two letters,
three letters, four, five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten, eleven, and twelve letters. There
are 10626 times four letters to be produced
out of the twenty four letters of the Alphabet,
and not twice four all the same Letters.
There are likewise 42504 times five letters,
134596 times six letters, 346104 times seven,
735471 times eight, 1307504 times
nine, 1961256 times ten, 2496144 times
eleven, and 2704156 times twelve. Now
each quantity being varied by the rules of
this Art, will produce incredible numbers.
First the 10626 times four letters, being
multiplied by 24, which are the number of
ways to vary each four letters, will produce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>255024 that is to say, four letters may
be produced out of the Alphabet to stand together
after this manner (<i>a b c d</i>) two hundred
fifty five thousand and twenty four
times, and not twice alike. And in like manner,
the 42504 times five Letters, being multiplied
by 120, which are the number of
ways to vary each five, will produce
5100480. The 134596 times six letters,
being also multiplied by 720, will produce
96909120. The 346104, being multiplied
by 5040, will produce 1744364160.<a id='t14'></a> The
735471, being multiplied by 40320, will
produce 29654190720.<a id='t14a'></a> The 1307504, being
multiplied by 362880, will produce
474467051520. The 1961256, being multiplied
by 3628800, will produce
7117005772800. The 2496144,<a id='t14b'></a> being
multiplied by 39916800, will produce
99638080819200.<a id='t14c'></a> And lastly, the 2704156
time twelve letters, being multiplied by
479001600, will produce 1295295050649600,
which products being all added together, as
also 12696 which are the numbers consisting
of two and three letters, the whole will amount
to 1402556105125320,<a id='t14d'></a> wherein
there are not two alike, nor two letters of
one sort in any one of them; which being
written or printed on large Paper in <i>folio</i>, allowing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>5000 to a sheet, they would take up
561022442<a id='t15'></a> Reams of Paper and upwards,
reckoning 500 sheets to a Ream: which Paper
all the Houses in the City and Liberties
of <i>London</i> would not contain; and in quantity
doubtless infinitely exceeds all the
Books that ever were printed in the world,
reckoning only one of each Impression. And
at the rate of five shillings the Ream, the Paper
would cost 140255610.5<a id='t15a'></a> Pounds sterling;
which is above four times as much as the yearly
Rent of all the Lands and Houses in <i>England</i>
amounts to. And all the people both
young and old in the City and Suburbs of
<i>London</i> (admitting they are five hundred
thousand) could not speak the like numbers
of words under forty years and upwards, each
of them speaking 15000 every hour,
and twelve hours every day. These prodigious
numbers are the more to be admired,
considering that the greatest number of letters
in any of them, exceeds not twelve, neither
are two letters of one sort in any one
of them: but by producing and varying all
the greater quantities, and placing two or
more letters of one sort, or two of one sort
and two of another, with all variety of the
like nature that commonly happens in words,
the numbers arising thereby would infinitely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>exceed the former; And if all the numbers of
every quantity of letters from one to twenty
four, together with all the variety as aforesaid,
were methodically drawn out and varied
according to the rules of this Art;
which might easily be performed in respect of
the plain and practical method of doing it;
but the infinite numbers of them would not
permit a Million of men to effect it in some
thousands of years: it would be evident,
that there is no word or syllable in any language
or speech in the world, which can be
exprest with the character of our <i>Alphabet</i>,
but might be found <i>literatim</i> and entire
therein; and more by many thousands of
Millions than can be pronounced, or that
ever were yet made use of in any language.</p>

<p class='c006'>I will here give one instance of another
kind, shewing the admirable effects of this
Art, and so conclude. A man having twenty
Horses, contracts with a Brick-maker to
give him one hundred pound Sterling; conditionally
that the Brick-maker will deliver
him as many Loads of Bricks, as there are several
Teams of six Horses to be produced out
of the aforesaid twenty to fetch them, and
not one Team or Sett of six Horses to fetch
two Loads. The Brick-maker might be
thought to have made a very advantageous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>bargain, but the contrary will appear. For
there are thirty eight thousand seven hundred
and sixty several Teams of six Horses,
to be produced out of twenty, and not twice
six the same Horses; then the Brick-maker
must deliver as many Loads as there are
Teams, and each Load consisting of five hundred
Bricks, the whole would amount to
19380000, which being bought for one hundred
pounds as aforesaid, would not cost above
five Farthings a thousand;  and at the
rate of thirteen shillings and four pence the
thousand, they amount to twelve thousand
nine hundred and twenty pounds Sterling.
But should a contract be made with the
Brick-maker to deliver as many Loads of
Bricks, as there are Teams of six Horses in
each, to be produced out of the aforesaid
twenty, which shall stand in the Cart in a differing
manner; that is to say, although there
may be the same Horses in several Teams,
yet their places shall be so changed, that they
shall not stand twice alike in any two Teams.
On this account the Brick-maker must deliver
seven hundred and twenty times as many
as before; for there are 38760 several Teams
as before I have shewed: then each Team
may be placed 720 ways in the Cart, and
not twice alike, which is to be done according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>to the methods whereby the 720 changes
on six Bells are rung. So that 38760,
which are the number of Teams, multiplied
by 720, which are the number of ways to vary
the six Horses in each Team, the product
will be  27907200, which are the compleat
number of Teams; and every Team carrying
one Load, consisting<a id='t18'></a> of five hundred
Bricks, the Whole will amount to
13953600000 Bricks. And after the proportion
of a hundred and fifty thousand of
Bricks to a House, they would build ninety
three thousand and twenty four Houses;
which are above six times as many as the late
dreadful fire in <i>London</i> consumed. And at the
rate of thirteen<a id='t18a'></a> shillings and four pence the
thousand, they are worth 6976800 pounds
Sterling, which is at least four hundred Waggon-loads
of money, as much as five Horses
can ordinarily draw.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'><span class='c012'>AN</span><br> <span class='c013'>INTRODUCTION</span><br> <span class='c012'>To the Practice of</span><br> RINGING</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>As the original design of casting Peals
of Bells was in order to make pleasant
Musick thereon; so the Notes
in every Peal are formed apt for
that end and purpose, every Peal of Bells being
tun’d according to the principles of Musick;
for in a Peal of six Bells are the six plain
Song-Notes, whereupon all Musick consists,
namely, <i>la sol fa mi re ut</i>. But in regard
that in ringing of them the Notes cannot be
had at command, as the Notes of other Instruments
may; therefore, as the Practitioners in
ancient time found some necessity to cause all
the Notes to strike successively after one another,
so likewise they thought fit in ringing
them to place the Notes in this following
order. The least note to lead or strike
first, then the Note which is the next degree
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>deeper or flatter, and so the rest of the notes
to strike after each other according to their
degrees, the flattest striking last; in which
order the notes were successively reiterated
both at fore-stroke and back-stroke, from the
beginning to the end of each Peal. And at
this day the same order is also observed in
raising, ceasing, and ringing them at a low
compass; wherein each note being confin’d
to strike in a certain place, therefore had
they their terms of First, Second, Third,
Fourth, Fifth, <i>&#38;c.</i> given them, to denote
their order and places of striking; from
whence also the Bells derive those terms of
distinction by which they are now known.
Although the ringing of a Peal of Bells
in the aforesaid order, (which is commonly
term’d <i>Round-ringing</i>) is in it self Musical;
yet the Notes may be so placed in ringing,
that their Musick may be rendred much more
pleasant: for in Musick there are Concords,
which indeed may be term’d the very life
and soul of it, that renders all Musick exceeding
pleasant: the principal are Thirds,
Fifths, and Eights; Thirds are 1 3. 2 4. and
such like: Fifths are 1 5. 2 6. <i>&#38;c.</i> Eights
are 1 8. 2 9. 3 10. <i>&#38;c.</i> each Concord consisting
of two notes. They may well be termed
Concords, in respect of their agreement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>and harmony; for the two notes (as if it were
by mutual consent) being struck together at
one instant, or else immediately after one
another, affords delightful melody to the
ear; in which respect, a peal of five Bells are
capable of making better Musick than a peal
of four; six better than five; and more especially
will ten or twelve make more excellent
Musick than any lesser numbers can possibly
do, there being greater variety of Concords
therein, and especially of Eights. For this Musical
end were changes on Bells first practised,
<i>changes</i> being nothing else but a moving and
placing of the Notes in ringing, whereby variety
of pleasant Musick is made; and as the
manner of moving the notes, is, for two
notes to change places with each other,
therefore are they called <i>Changes</i>. The methods
of changes being somewhat intricate,
I have therefore<a id='t21'></a> penn’d the following Treatise
as a Clue to guide the Practitioner
through the Labirinth of them, wherein I
have made use of figures to represent the
notes of Bells, the manner thus. In a peal of
five Bells there are five several notes, which
with figures are thus exprest, 1 2 3 4 5: the
figure 1 represents the least or sharpest note,
which is term’d the First, because its place
in round ringing is to lead; this note is most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>commonly called the <i>Treble</i>. The figure 2
represents the note which is the next degree
deeper or flatter, and is term’d the Second,
because it strikes in the second place. And in
like manner 3 represents the note of the third
Bell, 4 the note of the fourth Bell, and 5
the note of the Fifth or Tennor. In which
manner, the figures in all the following methods
do likewise represent the notes of
Bells.</p>

<p class='c006'>Since the ringing of changes requires the
peal of Bells, on which the changes are to be
rung, to be first raised up to a set Pull, which
compass is most proper for the ringing of
them; therefore the Learners first practice
must be to raise a Bell true in peal, to ring it
at a low compass, and also to cease it true
in peal, wherein consists the chief grounds
of this Art, which depends on the Ear, and
therefore much judgment is required therein.
And to speak the truth, most practitioners
are in these days somewhat deficient
herein; the ringing of changes having generally
diverted the Learners fancy from the
practice of <i>raising</i>, <i>round-ringing</i>, and <i>ceasing</i>,
by which means we have in a manner lost
one Excellency in the pursuit of another.
Therefore I could wish that the Practitioners
of this Art would set a greater esteem on true
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Ringing in general, since the only excellency
as well in the ringing of Changes as Rounds,
depends thereon: the keeping of time being
as essential to render all kinds of ringing
pleasant to the ear, as ’tis to render any other
kind of Musick; therefore the practitioner
ought to have a Musical eare, and to have
some judgment in beating time, without
which he can never ring his Bell true in its
place. A prospect of true ringing at any certain
compass under the Sett, may thus be taken;
for Instance, in ringing a peal of 5 Bells;
from the fore-stroke of every note to the next
fore-stroke of the same note, there ought to
be eleven <i>punctums</i> or Beats of time, which
are all supposed to stand at Æquidistances:
now in ten of these <i>punctums</i>, the five notes
ought exactly to strike at the fore-stroke and
back-stroke, and the eleventh stands as a Cypher
to guide the Treble-note at fore-stroke
to a double proportion of time from the Tennor-note
at back-stroke: which blank <i>punctum</i>
must also be beaten in the same place by
every note, to render its fore-stroke answerable
to that of the Treble. For example;
the third note having struck at fore-stroke,
it must beat eleven <i>punctums</i> of equidistance
unto its striking there again. The first <i>punctum</i>
is that of the 4<sup>th</sup> note, the second 5, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>third 1, the fourth 2, the fifth 3, the sixth 4,
the seventh 5, the eighth 0, the ninth 1, the
tenth 2, the eleventh its own place of striking
again at fore-stroke. These <i>punctums</i>
or Beats of time, must be proportioned either
wider or closer, according to the compass
of the Treble: therefore first the Treble
must fix its compass certain and true at
fore-stroke, which ought to be proportionate
to what the number of the notes, and
compass of the peal of Bells, may according
to judgment permit; and then from one
fore-stroke of it to the next, if there are five
notes; there ought to be eleven <i>punctums</i>
of equidistance assigned, wherein the notes
should exactly strike (except the blank) as
before. From hence ’tis, that the most judicious
Ringer ought to be put to the Treble;
for that bell cannot possibly be rung true by
any other means than by beating of its own
time; and although the exactness of true
ringing requires the like in every note, when
once the compass is fixed, yet the leading
note being rung true, may be a guide to the
rest of the notes, which may tolerably take
their measures of time from the Treble-note:
but for every note to take its measure of
time solely from the next preceding note,
must needs be very erronious; for thereby
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>they implicitely lead one another out of the
way. Or else in the ringing of five bells,
from the fore-stroke of every note to the next
fore-stroke of the same note, there may be
one and twenty <i>punctums</i> or beats of time assigned,
to stand at equidistances; and the five
notes, as they follow one another, at the fore-stroke
and back-stroke to strike in every second
<i>punctum</i>, except the Treble-note at fore-stroke,
which must strike in the third <i>punctum</i>
from the Tenor at back-stroke; so that
then there will be two of those spaces betwixt
every note, and three betwixt the
note of the Tenor at back-stroke and the note
of the Treble at fore-stroke, which possibly
by some may be held a better compass than
the former: but <i>quot homines tot sententiæ</i>. Every
Practitioner, that has judgment to beat
his own time, has the advantage of ringing
his bell true, whilst the rest of the notes commit
faults; for the compass being once fixed,
as many bells as do either rise or fall from
thence commit errors.</p>

<p class='c006'>The truest way of raising a peal of bells according
to the best of modern practice, is, as
quick as may be; every Ringer taking assistance
to raise his bell, according as the going
of it requires. In raising of them, the lesser
bells as the Treble <i>&#38;c.</i> ought at the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>pull to be swayed very deep, and held down
in the sway by strength of armes as much as
may be, to delay the time of their first striking,
by which means the bigger bells, which
carry a large compass, may have space to
come in; and the raising of the smaller bells
to be continued with a strong pull, giving
them scope over head (for the aforesaid reason)
untill they come up Frame-high, or
thereabouts, and then the pull to be slacken’d,
and the bells leisurely to be raised to the intended
height or pitch. The bigger bells of
the peal, as the Tenor <i>&#38;c.</i> must in their first
raising be checkt or pinch’d over head, by
which means the notes of all the bells may be
made to strike round in their due place and
order from the beginning; and observe, that
at the first pull all the bells must follow one
another as close as may be. A peal of bells
may thus be ceased: the falling of the bells
from a Sett-pull must gradually be done, by
checking them only at Sally, until the low
compass renders the Sally useless; and when
they are ceased so low, that they scarce strike
at back-stroke for want of compass: then he
that rings the Treble, may give notice (by
stamping on the ground) that the next time
the bells come to strike at the fore-stroke,
they may be checkt down so low as to cease
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>their striking at the back-stroke, yet their
striking round at the fore-stroke may be continued,
until they are brought into a chime,
which is a graceful conclusion of a peal.</p>

<p class='c006'>In raising of a peal of bells, all the notes
ought to strike round at one pull: but mistake
me not, I do not mean at the first pull; for at
small bells ’tis usual to sway them all round at
the first pull without striking; at the second
pull to strike them at the fore-stroke, and at
the third pull at back-stroke. In raising of a
peal of more weighty bells, ’tis usual to strike
them double at the fourth pull, because the
extraordinary weight and large compass of
the hind-bells permits it not to be done sooner.
In the first raising of a peal of bells,
one bell ought not to strike before the rest, or
to miss striking when the rest go round: neither
ought any bell in ceasing to strike after
the rest, or to leave striking before the rest;
all which, according to the strictness of true
ringing, are accounted great faults.</p>

<p class='c006'>The peal of bells on which the changes are
to be rung, must first be raised up to a Sett-pull,
which compass is most proper for the
ringing of changes; for then the notes of the
bells may be had at command. Therefore
before the young Practitioner can be capable
of ringing changes, he must be extraordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>well skill’d in the managing of a bell at a Sett-pull,
which is absolutely requisite, for this reason:
In the ringing of changes, his mind
will be so busied and wholly taken up with
the consideration of the course and method of
them, and his eye continually wandring about
to direct his pull in the following of the
other bells; that unless he has extraordinary
skill in the managing of his own bell, and
can set it in a manner hood-winkt, he will be
apt either to drop or overturn it; or else on
the other hand, for want of skill, his eye and
mind will be so fixed on his own rope and bell
to guide the managing of it, that he cannot
at the same time mind the course of the changes,
and then no wonder if he is in a wood,
which consequently follows; and indeed
hence partly ’tis, that the Learners in their
first practice do oftentimes toil and moil
themselves to so little purpose. Therefore
’tis not enough that the young Practitioner
can set a bell it may be half a score times together,
when ’tis an even wager that he either
drops or overturns it in those ten-pulls:
but he must be so perfectly skill’d, as that he
might adventure to lay ten to one, that he
can set it thirty or forty times together,
both fore-stroke and back-stroke, without
dropping or overturning it, and without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>looking directly either on his hands or rope
whilst he sets it. Therefore in his practice
of setting a bell, he may cast his eye about
on the other bell-ropes whilst he manageth
his bell, whereby he may accustom himself to
manage it as the ringing of changes requires.</p>

<p class='c006'>The ringing of changes is performed, partly
by the ear, and partly by the eye; the ear
informs when to make a change, the eye directs
the pull in the making of it, but then
again the ear guides the striking of the note
true in its place according to time. So that
the ear and eye have each of them its proper
object in the ringing of changes, and therefore
ought at the same time to be absolutely
free from all others whatsoever, the notes of
the bells being the object of the ear, and the
bell-ropes the object of the eye. Now these
two Senses in the time of ringing do each of
them thus perform its office. First, the ear,
as a Sentinel, discovers the near approaching
change, and also the place wherein his note
lies, that is, whether before or behind the
note wherewith ’tis to make a change, and
gives present information to the eye, to perform
its part accordingly in the making of it;
but then again the eye refers it to the ear,
to place the note true in striking. But questionless
(by the bie) the truest ringing of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>changes is to be performed only by the ear;
but then the Practitioners must be capable
to judg of time, and to beat it true, which
must be the only direction to guide their
pull; and then it must be performed at a peal
of bells that may be managed with ease: and
being so fitted in all respects, the changes
may doubtless be rung more true, with greater
pleasure to the Practitioners, and much
more free from mistakes and forgets, only by
the ear, than by making use of the eye to direct
their pull. But in regard that either the
ill going of the bells, or want of fit accomplishments
in the practitioners, may render
it unfit for common practice; therefore the
surest way is to ring both by the eye and ear,
as I said before. Now to render the eye and
ear rightly useful in the ringing of changes,
five things ought by the young Practitioner
to be well understood. First, he must be
able to distinguish the notes of a peal of bells,
and to know one from another in the time of
ringing. Secondly, he must apprehend the
places of the notes. Thirdly, the precedency
of notes. Fourthly, the manner of making
a change in ringing. Fifthly, a general prospect
of the manner of putting the four preceding
notions into practice.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Observation 1.</i> The Learner must be able
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>to distinguish the notes of a peal of bells one
from another, and to know them asunder; as
the Treble-note from the Second, the Second
from the Third, <i>&#38;c.</i> which, tis true, may
readily be done in round ringing, because
each note may be known by the place wherein
it constantly strikes; but in ringing of
changes it is more difficult. For admitting
that six bells should strike in this order,
5.3.6.1.4.2. it might puzzle an unskilful ear
to judg which is the Treble, or which the Second
note, especially whilst any other note
strikes betwixt them: and the like difficulty
might happen in distinguishing the rest of the
notes, as the <i>2d</i> from the <i>3d</i>, <i>&#38;c.</i> To remove
this difficulty, he must endeavour to
acquire some skill in tuning the notes of a
peal of bells, with his voice, which he may do
by imitating the notes of the bells when he
hears them ring: or else any person that has
skill in singing, will presently direct him
therein, and also how to take the true pitch
of any notes with his voice, which will be the
only means to distinguish them asunder.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Observ. 2d.</i> The Learner must rightly apprehend
the places of the notes, which I think
cannot better be done than by this means.
Considering that the notes of a peal of bells
do all strike one after another at the fore-stroke,
and the like at back-stroke; it might
be requisite for him to imagine, that the
notes in their striking do lie in a direct line,
that is, in a row at the fore-stroke, and the
like again at back-stroke; for then the places
of the notes will much resemble the places
of the figures wherewith the changes are
prickt: for as the figures of every change
do all stand in a row; so likewise the notes of
the bells, being imagined to strike in the
like row, he may the more readily apprehend
the places of the notes, and consequently of
changing them. For the practick part of
this Art, is performed by means of imaginary,
not real notions; which will thus manifestly
appear. This is the platform
of a Frame, wherein five bells
may be supposed to hang in a
Steeple, the figures therein representing
the places wherein the five bells
hang. Now in the sixscore changes on five
bells, we will suppose the Treble to be the
whole Hunt, and to hunt up first over the Second,
then over the Third, <i>&#38;c.</i> Now the
Treble cannot really move out of the place
wherein it hangs; but by delaying its striking
untill the Second Bell has struck, it may
by that means strike next after it; and again,
by delaying its striking until the Third has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>struck; it may also strike next after that, this
being the true manner of the changes; by
which ’tis evident, that the bells have neither
really such places nor motion as is pretended,
but is meerly imaginary, and was at
first feigned only as a Guide to direct the
Practitioner’s apprehension in the ringing of
them. So that although the art of changes
is in it self a real thing, yet the notions by
which they are reduced to practice on bells,
are not so. For which reason, the several
practitioners of this Art, before they can become
expert, are fain to form in their minds
imaginary notions to guide them; some after
one manner, some perhaps after another,
according to their several fancies, yet all tending,
to render the methods of changes practicable
on bells; and having once form’d in
their minds such imaginary helps, they become
expert in short time: and then no sooner
do they understand the methods of changes
prickt with figures, which they commonly
discover at first view; but they are presently
capable of ringing them readily on
bells, which experience daily testifies. And
hence it is, that oftentimes the Learners, although
they perfectly understand the methods
of changes prickt, and also can perfectly
manage a Bell; yet for want of a right apprehension
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>of the nature of changing the
notes, which of themselves it may be they
cannot soon attain, are therefore much puzzled<a id='t34'></a>
in their first practice of ringing changes.
Therefore as a guide, the Learner must first
form in his mind a fit representation of the
places of the notes; which I think cannot
better be done, than by imagining each note
to be a figure; as the Treble-note to be the
figure 1, the second note the figure 2, the
third note the figure 3, and the like of the
rest. Then whensoever he hears a peal of
bells ring, let him by strength of imagination
conceit, that each note bears the shape of a
figure; that is, at the same instant of time
that the note strikes, he may imagine that it
leaves the impression of the figure behind it,
and that with the eye of his imagination he
perfectly sees it: and likewise as the notes
of the bells do all strike after one another at
the fore-stroke, so he may imagine that they
lie in a row in the shape of figures; and the
like again at back-stroke. For instance: suppose
that five Muskets were charged with
five bullets, and that each bullet bears the
shape of a figure; one Gun to be charged
with the figure 1, another with the figure 2,
and the other three Guns with these three
figures, 3. 4. 5. Then supposing a straight
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>line were drawn upon the wall, thus ——————————
and that the five Muskets were by five men
levell’d against the line, which is to be the
mark for them to shoot at; the figure 1 to
be first shot off, then the figure 2, and so the
rest in order immediately after one another:
now at the same instant of time that the
Guns are heard to go off, the five figures
would appear
in a
row upon
the wall, thus.
<img src='images/i035.jpg' alt='–1–2–3–4–5–' class='height3'>
So in like manner when he
hears a peal of five bells strike after one another
at the fore-stroke, and again at back-stroke,
he may imagine that at the very instant
of their striking their notes appear to
his apprehension in the shape of the five figures,
and that they strike in a row, thus,
1 2 3 4 5, as if each Bell were a Gun, and
had shot out its note in the shape of a figure.
There being necessity that the young Practitioner
must either imagine each note to
be a real figure, or else a representative: for
as the ear is to be his guide to direct when to
make each change; so a right apprehension
of the motion and places of the notes, must
be a means to guide his ear. Now in regard
that the changes are first prickt with figures,
from whence the notes of the bells derive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>their course, therefore if in ringing he imagine
each note to be a real figure, then the
same knowledge that guides the pricking,
guides also as readily the ringing of them,
for then the note of his bell is supposed to
have the same course with that of a real figure.
But if he imagines that each note is
not a real, but a representative of a figure;
then consequently it must only have the like,
and not the same course: by which means,
whilst he is ringing of changes, his mind must
have frequent recourse to his Pocket, that is,
to the changes there prickt; from whence
he must continually fetch instructions to direct
the course of his Bell, which is oftentimes
the case of the Learner: his thoughts in
the time of ringing being commonly upon
the figures that are prickt, either upon paper,
or else upon the Steeple-wall, whilst it
should be wholly intent upon the notes.
Therefore in a word, the Practitioner whilst
he is ringing of changes, must fix his mind
fully and wholly upon the notes of the bells,
and not permit it in the least to wander from
thence; for the notes are to be the sole object
of the thoughts in the time of ringing.</p>

<p class='c006'>The notes being imagined to strike in a
row as aforesaid, their places will then soon
be understood. The notes do take their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>places according to their successive order of
striking both at fore-stroke and back-stroke;
each succeeding note taking its place next to
that which preceds it: for whatsoever bell
leads either at fore-stroke or at back-stroke,
its note lieth in the first place of the supposed
row of notes; and that which strikes next after
the leading note, its note lieth in the second
place of the supposed row of notes, and
so the rest in the like order. As if five bells
should strike thus after one another either
of fore-stroke or back-stroke, 5 4 1 2 3. here
the <i>5th</i> lieth in the first place, because it was
first struck; the <i>4th</i> in the second place, because
it was second struck; the Treble in the
third place, because it was third struck; the
<i>2d</i> in the fourth place, because it was fourth
struck; and the <i>3d</i> in the last place, because
it was last struck; and the like of the notes
in every change.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Observ. 3.</i> The next thing to be understood by
the Learner, is the precedency of
the notes. Now whereas in the ringing of
changes, the notes do all strike after one another
at the fore-stroke, and again at the back-stroke,
therefore are they said to lie before
or behind each other, according to their places
of striking. As if five men were standing
in a row, as these five figures represent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>1 2 3 4 5, the first man to stand at the fig. 1,
the second man at the figure 2, <i>&#38;c.</i> and that
they stand with their faces all one way, that
is, the first man ready to lead, and the rest to
follow him one behind another. Now the
first man stands before the rest, and the fifth
man behind the rest; the second man stands
behind the first man, but before the third;
the third man stands behind the second, but
before the fourth; and the fourth stands behind
the third, but before the fifth. In which
manner the notes being supposed to strike
in the like row, may also be laid to lie before
or behind each other as the men did. For
whatsoever note leads either at fore-stroke
or back-stroke, is said to lie before the rest;
and that which strikes last, to strike behind
the rest. The note which lieth in the second
place, as on the one hand it lieth behind the
leading note, so on the other hand it lieth
before the note in the third place. As the
note in the third place lieth behind the note
in the second place, so it lieth before the note
in the fourth place. And in like manner,
every note is said to lie behind those that
strike before it, and before those that strike
after it.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Observ. 4.</i> A Change is to be made betwixt
two notes, by moving them into each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>others places; wherein ’tis to be observed
as a general Rule, That every change must
be made betwixt two notes that strike next
to each other. As if five bells were ringing
round in this order, 12345, the 1 and 2 may
make a change, or 2 and 3, or likewise 3 and
4, or 4 and 5, because each two lie next each
other; but the 1 and 3 cannot, because 2
strikes between them, much less may 1 and 4,
<i>&#38;c.</i> The two notes which make every change,
moves into each others places in the making
of it; wherein one note is said to move <i>up</i>,
and the other <i>down</i>. The reason why one of
them is said to move up, is, because he that
rings that bell, in the making of the change
must hold it up at the Sett a little longer than
ordinary, to delay its striking, whereby ’tis
made to follow the other note which before
it preceded; and because ’tis so held up,
therefore ’tis said to make an <i>Up-change</i>, or
to move up: and on the contrary, the reason
why the other note is said to move
down, is, because he that rings it, pulls
down the bell a little sooner than ordinary,
to make it strike before the note which before
it followed; and because ’tis so pulled
down, therefore it is said to make a <i>Down-change</i>,
or to move down. I will here give a
short though certain rule to know when an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Up-change or a Down-change is to be made:
whensoever any note moves to strike behind
the note wherewith it makes a change, it
makes an up-change in doing it; and whensoever
it moves to strike before the note,
which ’tis to make a change with, it makes a
down-change in doing it: so that every note
which moves fromward the leading-note,
makes an up-change; and when it moves toward
the leading-note, it makes a down-change.
I will here shew the manner of making
a change: admitting that a peal of five
bells were raised to a sett-pull, which is the
usual compass for ringing of changes; the
notes are first supposed to strike in this order,
12345. Now a change may be made betwixt
any two notes that strike next each
other; I will here make it betwixt the 3d.
and 4th. which is to be done by moving
them into each others’ places. Now ’tis observable,
that before the making of the
change, the 3d. note lies before the 4th.
that is, it strikes next before the 4th; and
the 4th. lies behind the 3d. that is, it strikes
behind it: now in the making of the change,
the 3d. must move to strike behind the 4th:
wherein it makes an up-change; and the 4th.
note at the same time must move to strike before
the 3d. wherein it makes a down-change;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>the change being made, the bells will strike
thus, 12435. All changes whatsoever are
made in the aforesaid manner: for as the <i>3d</i>
note made an up-change in moving to strike
behind the <i>4th</i>, and the <i>4th</i> at the same time
a down-change in moving to strike before the
<i>3d</i>; so in like manner the two notes that make
every change, must in the making of it move
the one up, and the other down, as the <i>3d</i>
and <i>4th</i> here has done. The Learner may
take notice, that in ringing termes ’tis not
usual to say, that a bell makes an up-change,
or a down-change; but in short, that it <i>moves
up</i> or <i>down</i>, which implies the former. When
a note makes an up-change, ’tis then said to
move <i>over</i> the other note; and when it makes
a down-change, to move <i>under</i> it: as in the
next preceding example, where the <i>3d</i> note
is said to move up over the <i>4th</i>, and the <i>4th</i>
down under the <i>3d</i>, in which manner the
terms <i>over</i> and <i>under</i> are given to the two
notes that make every change.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Observ. 5.</i> In the time of ringing changes,
two things are by the Practitioners to be
well considered. First, to observe and readily
to know, which two bells are always to
make the next succeeding change: Secondly,
if he is concern’d therein, to consider
what bell he is to follow in the making of it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>Upon a right knowledge of these two things,
depends the Practick part of this Art. To
make him expert herein, he must before
hand perfectly understand, and readily remember
the course and method of the changes
prickt with figures, wherein he ought to
be so well skill’d, as to be able to prick them
down divers ways, that is, to make any figure
a Hunt at pleasure; which when he can readily
and speedily do, without pausing to consider
of the course, then ’tis presumed that he
understands the methods throughly. But yet
he will not be capable to put them in practice,
untill he understands the manner of
making a change in ringing; neither can he
understand that, until he understands the
precedency of the notes; nor the precedency,
until he understands the places; nor the
places, until he knows the notes one from another.
Therefore the four preceding observations
being first perfectly understood, and
also the methods of the changes as before;
the Practitioner may then successfully proceed
in the ringing of changes; and as a further
help therein I will here instruct him.
There are three bells concern’d in the making
of every single change, except only when ’tis
made behind, and then but two: whensoever
the note of his bell is to make a change with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>any other note, his ear must then inform him
whether it lies before or behind the other
note; if it lies before, then in making the
change it must move up behind it, that is, to
follow it; and consequently, he must draw
down his bell next after that which he makes
a change with, which is called an up-change,
as I said before. But if the note of his bell
lies behind the other, then in making of the
change it must move down to strike before it,
and consequently he must draw down his bell
next after that which the other before followed,
this being a down-change. So that
the making of an up-change is very easie, because
he must always follow that bell which
he makes a change with; but a down-change
is more difficult, because he cannot so readily
apprehend what bell he is to follow; yet
there is a certain rule for it, which is this:
to observe beforehand what note strikes the
next but one before his, which bell he must
follow in the making of the change. Whensoever
the two notes, which strike next before
his note, are to make a change; he must consider,
that notwithstanding his note is to lie
still in its place, yet he is concern’d therein,
because the bell which he followed before
the making of the change, must in the making
of it move away down, and therefore he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>must follow the bell that comes into its place.</p>

<p class='c006'>The changes are to be rung, either by
<i>walking</i> them, as the term is; or else Whole-pulls,
or Half-pulls. By <i>walking</i> them, is
meant, that the bells go round four, six, eight
times or more in one change; which way is
very proper for young Practitioners, to introduce
them into a more ready way of Practice;
for whilst the bells go round divers
times in one change, they have in the mean
time leisure to consider which two bells are
to make the next following change, and also
what bell each of them is to follow in the
making of it; and so by diligence in practice
they will by degrees acquire a more ready
skill to enable them to ring at whole-pulls.
Whole-pulls, is, when the bells go round at
the fore-stroke and back-stroke in a change;
and every time they are pull’d down at Sally,
a new change is made. Whole-pulls was the
general practice in former times; and indeed,
considering the manner of the hanging of the
bells in those days, they could not well be
rung at half-pulls: but since the improvement
of the Art of Bell-hanging, that is, with
round Wheels, trussing them up in the Stock,
and placing the Roll at right Angles with
the Sole of the Wheel; the bells go much
better, and are managed with more ease at a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Sett-pull than formerly: therefore the changes
are now generally rung at half-pulls, that
is, at the fore-stroke one change, at the back-stroke
another, and so throughout.</p>

<p class='c006'>In ringing half-pulls, some peals of changes
will cut compass, wherein the whole
Hunt comes always to lead at the back-stroke;
to prevent which, make the first
change of the peal at the back-stroke. In
plain and single changes on six bells, to hunt
(that is, whole Hunt) the Treble, third, or
fifth, down at the beginning of a peal cuts
compass, unless prevented as before. Also to
hunt the second, fourth, or sixth up at the
beginning of a peal, cuts compass, unless prevented
as before. Which rules, leaving out
the Tenor, serves in like manner to prevent
cutting compass on five bells.</p>

<p class='c006'>’Tis convenient in ringing, to give notice
of the extream changes, and he that rings the
slowest Hunt, may best do it. The manner
of it is, to say <i>Extream</i>, when the leading bell
is pulling down, in order to make the change
next before the extream; by which means
there will be one compleat change betwixt
the warning and the extream: longer warning
would be too much, and shorter too little.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>The divers kinds of changes on Bells may
be comprehended under two heads,
<i>viz.</i> Plain Changes, and Cross Peals, which
terms are comparatively given: for as the
first are plain and easie only in comparison
to the methods of the second; so consequently
the second cross and intricate in
comparison to the methods of the first. I
will first shew in what respect they differ, and
then proceed to the methods. Plain changes
(I mean compleat peals) are such as have
one universal method, wherein all the notes
except three have a direct hunting course,
moving gradually under each other in one
plain and uniform order. But the methods
of cross peals are various, each peal having a
course differing from all others: and although
most of them have Hunts, yet the
Hunts have different kinds of motions, and
some very intricate. Moreover plain changes
are also term’d Single changes, because
in the ringing of them there is only a single
change made in the striking of all the notes
once round either at fore-stroke or back-stroke;
whereas in cross changes ’tis usual to
make as many changes as the number of notes
will permit. For example, supposing that a
peal of 5 bells were raised, and rung at a Sett-pull;
the notes are supposed to strike round
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>in this order, 12345: now any two of the
notes that strike next together may make a
change, therefore either a single or a double
change may be made at pleasure. The single
change is made by changing only two notes;
the double change is made by changing four
notes, that is, two to make one change and two
another, yet ’tis called one double change, and
not two changes, in regard ’tis made in the
striking of the five notes of the bells once
round: as, admit the treble, second, third,
and fourth, should make a change, ’tis thus
to be done, 21435, where the Treble and
Second made one change, and 3, 4 another;
which we will imagine to<a id='t47'></a> be made at the
fore-stroke of the bells, and therefore ’tis called
one double change, and not two changes,
because ’tis entirely made in the striking of
the five notes once round. So that this one
double change has effected that which would
have required two single changes to have
done the like. For instance, there can but
two notes change their places at once in a
single change, therefore the Treble and Second
shall first change their places thus,
21345; then the third and fourth thus,
21435: so that here the five notes have gone
twice round to effect that, which in the double
change was done in going once round.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>And this is the nature of the difference between
Plain and Cross changes.</p>

<p class='c006'>As the Learner ought to proceed regularly
in his practice, beginning first with the
plainest and easiest methods. I will therefore
observe that order, and first shew the
course and methods of Plain changes.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>The Changes on two Bells.</i></h3>

<p class='c006'>The six changes can be rung no more
than these two ways here set down.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Six changes are sometimes rung by observing
a hunt therein, which is very improper,
since every note has a like course. Yet I
confess in demonstrating the methods on
twelve, I did there admit a Hunt into the six
changes; but that was only for demonstration
sake.</p>

<p class='c006'>The compleat peals of plain changes, from
three to all greater numbers whatsoever, as
the Twenty four changes on four, the Sixscore
on five, the Seven hundred and twenty on six,
<i>&#38;c.</i> are prickt and rung by one method; all
the notes having a hunting-motion, except
only three in each peal, which three do make
the six changes in the same manner as they
are before prickt. So that the Six changes on
three may be term’d the <i>basis</i> or foundation
of the compleat peals on all greater numbers.</p>

<p class='c006'>Every Hunting note in each peal has a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>certain number of notes assigned, through
which ’tis always to hunt. The term <i>hunt</i>
is given to a note in respect of the manner of
its motion, which I will shew in this example.
First, the notes of four bells are supposed to
strike round in this order, 1234. The Treble
shall be the Hunt, and the other three assigned
or appointed for it to hunt through. Now
whereas the Treble-note leads, it must move
through its assigned number to strike behind
them: and whereas every change must be
made betwixt two notes that strike next each
other, as I have shewed before in the <i>4th
Observation</i>; therefore the hunting-note is
confin’d to move gradually through the rest
by making a change with each note that
strikes next to it; and accordingly it must
first move into the <i>2d</i> place, next into the <i>3d</i>
place, and lastly into the <i>4th</i>. So that ’tis to
make a change with every note that lies behind

<p class='c006'>’Tis observable, that here the Treble
made down-changes all the way, which of
necessity it must do, because every note with
which it was to make a change, lay before it:
and because it made down-changes, therefore
it is said to have hunted down. This is the
manner of the motion of the hunting notes
in all peals of plain changes; for they hunt up
and down through their assigned number, as
the 1 here has done. This example is plain
and full to instruct the Learner in the hunting
of any bell, therefore he ought to peruse it
diligently, that he may understand the true
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>scope and meaning of it; and as a help he may
apply himself to practice by taking a Treble,
and attempt to hunt it up and down as this
Example directs; which he may the more
readily do, if he understand the <i>5th Observation</i>
before set down, which guides him to
make a change in ringing. So that partly by
reading and well considering of what I have
here wrote, and partly by practice, he may
in a short time become perfect in the hunting
motion of any note; which when he rightly
apprehends, he will then presently be capable
of understanding the following methods; and
therefore I shall be the more brief in my directions
to them.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>The Changes on four Bells.</i></h3>

<p class='c016'>Twenty four changes may be
rung upon four bells: but the
Learner may first practice the
twelve changes, and the eighteen
changes. In the twelve changes
the notes are all to be hunted up
after one another, which may be
called the Twelve all over. First
the treble-note must be hunted
up, letter (<i>a</i>); then the second note
must likewise hunt up, letter (<i>b</i>); next the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>third note must hunt up, letter
(<i>c</i>); and lastly the <i>4th</i> note also,

<p class='c006'>The four notes may also hunt down one
after another. First, the <i>4th</i> note must hunt
down to lead: then the <i>3d</i> note likewise,

which may be term’d the Twelve all under.</p>

<p class='c018'>Courteous Reader, in my directions to
the course of each peal, I do there refer
by letters to the examples; which I
am forced to do, to prevent those confused
breaks, and unhandsome spaces,
which otherwise would have happen’d
both in examples and precepts. Whatever
letter I mention in my directions,
refers to the like at the figures. For instance;
in my directions to the twelve
changes next before, I there directed
the treble-note to be first hunted up,
letter (<i>a</i>); which letter refers to
the like letter at the first
three changes of the twelve,
where the Treble hunted
up, as ’tis here again represented,
and the like of the rest.</p>

First it hunts up into the <i>3d</i> place,

<p class='c006'>The Six changes on three are the ground of
the Twenty four changes on four; for one of
the four notes hath a constant hunting motion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>through the other three, in the same
manner as in the preceding Example, <i>page <a href='#Page_50'>50</a>.</i>
and the three notes are to make the six changes
in the same manner as I have before
shewed in the changes on three bells; one of
the six changes being always made every
time the hunt lies either before or behind
the three bells: therefore if the Learner do
but rightly apprehend the course of the six
changes, and also the manner of the motion
of the hunting note, he will presently understand
the method of the twenty four changes.
The six changes in the twenty four, according
to the terms of ringing are called
Extream changes, and the three bells which
makes them, Extream bells. So that in the
twenty four changes, there is a hunt and
three extream bells. Every time the hunt
lies either before or behind the extream bells,
an extream change must then be made. The
extream changes may be made two ways, <i>viz.</i>
either betwixt the two farthest extream
bells from the hunt, or else betwixt the two
nearest extream bells to it. In
this Example every extream
change shall be made betwixt the
two farthest extream bells from
the hunt, and the treble shall be
the hunting note, which must first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>hunt up (<i>a</i>); then the two farthest
notes from the hunt, which are 2.3,
must make an extream change (<i>b</i>).
The Treble must hunt down (<i>c</i>).
The two farthest notes from the
hunt, which are 2.4, must make an
extream change (<i>d</i>). The treble
must hunt up (<i>e</i>); the two farthest
notes from the hunt, which are 3.4,
must make an extream change (<i>f</i>).
The treble-note must hunt down
(<i>g</i>). The two farthest extream bells
from the hunt, which are 3.2, must
make an extream change (<i>h</i>). The
treble must hunt up (<i>i</i>). The two
farthest notes from the hunt, which
are 4.2, must make an extream
change (<i>k</i>). The treble must hunt down (<i>l</i>).
The two farthest extream bells, which are 4.3,
must make an extream change (<i>m</i>), which concludes
the peal. Now the Learner for his satisfaction
may take out the extream changes
in the same order as they were made, as first
at (<i>b</i>), then (<i>d</i>), and so (<i>f.h.k.m.</i>) and they
will stand as they are here set down;
where ’tis evident, that 2.3.4 have
made the six changes according to
the method of the first six changes
on three bells, before set down,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>(<i>page <a href='#Page_48'>48</a>.</i>) where the first change of that six
was 213, and this being 324, is the same in
course though the figures differ, and the rest
of the changes in this six, are likewise the
same in course and method with those.</p>

<p class='c006'>The six extream changes, <i>viz.</i>
(<i>b.d.f.h.k.</i> and <i>m.</i>) being set
down by themselves, will stand
in this order, as here you see;
where ’tis plain, that 2 3 4 have
made the six changes, according to the method
of the last six changes on three
bells, <i>page <a href='#Page_49'>49</a>.</i> where the first change
of that six is made between the last
two notes thus, 1 3 2. So in like
manner is the first here thus, 243,
which is the same method with that,
though not the same figures.</p>

<p class='c006'>So that the making of the extream
changes two ways in the twenty four,
proceeds from the two ways of making the
six changes on three bells. This last way of
making the extream changes, may, for distinction
from the other way, be called <i>mediums</i>;
which term is very proper, in regard
that the two middlemost of the four notes do
always make the extream change. The extream
changes in one peal must all be made
alike, that is, either betwixt the two farthest
notes from the hunt, or else betwixt the two
nearest notes to it; but the most usual way is
to make them between the two farthest.</p>

<p class='c006'>Any note may be made a hunt at pleasure,
and its first motion at the beginning of the
peal may be either up or down. The twenty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>four changes may be rung sixteen ways according
to the aforesaid method, yet the changes
to each are still one and the same; but by
making each note a hunt, and moving it either
up or down at the beginning,
and also by making
the extream changes two
ways, the course of the
changes will be so altered,
that the same changes shall
not come all along together
in any two of those sixteen
ways. With the hunting of
one note it may be rung
four ways; for the note may
move either up or down at
the beginning of the peal;
then in its motion either
way the extream changes
maybe made two ways, as
before: so that to make
each note a hunt, and with
each hunt to ring it four
ways makes sixteen in the
whole. Wherein ’tis observable,
that the treble-note
cannot be moved down
at first, nor the <i>4th</i> up;
therefore an extream change must first be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>made, which is as effectual as if either note
had moved at first. I have here prickt the
twenty four changes three ways, wherein the
extream changes are all made betwixt the
two farthest notes from the hunt.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the Sixscore changes, four of the notes
do make the Twenty four changes, and the
fifth note hunts continually through them:
so that the course and method of the Sixscore
is in effect the same with that of the Four and
twenty. For as the Four and twenty comprehended
the Six changes on three; so in like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>manner the Sixscore comprehend the Four
and twenty changes on four, and the Six changes
on three. Therefore in the Sixscore there
must be two hunts and three extream bells;
one of the hunts is term’d the whole-hunt,
and the other the half-hunt, The three extream
bells do make the Six changes in the
same manner as they were made before in
the Four and twenty changes upon four bells,
and are here also call’d Extream changes:
the half-hunt and three extream bells do
make the Four and twenty changes in the
same manner as the Four and twenty
changes on four bells were likewise made:
and the whole hunt continually hunts
through those four bells, and every time it
either leads or lies behind them, one change
must then be made in the twenty four.
1 shall here be the whole-hunt,
2 the half-hunt, and 345 extream
bells: so that 2345 must
make the four and twenty changes.
Every extream change
shall be made betwixt the two
farthest extream bells from the
half-hunt. First, the treble
hunts up (<i>a</i>). One of the twenty
four changes must now be made;
and therefore 2 which is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>hunt in the twenty four, must
begin its motion through the
extream bells (<i>b</i>). The treble
hunts down (<i>c</i>); the half-hunt
must proceed in its course (<i>d</i>);
the whole-hunt hunts up (<i>e</i>);
The half-hunt proceeds forward
(<i>f</i>); the whole-hunt moves down
(<i>g</i>). The half-hunt should now
proceed, but having finished its
course through the extream
bells, therefore an extream
change must now be made betwixt
the two farthest extream
bells from it, which are 3.4 (<i>h</i>).
The treble must hunt up (<i>i</i>);
the half-hunt must now begin its
course again through the extream
bells (<i>k</i>); treble hunts
down (<i>l</i>); the half-hunt proceeds
in its course down (<i>m</i>);
treble hunts up (<i>n</i>); the half-hunt
proceeds in its course down
(<i>o</i>); treble hunts down (<i>p</i>); the
half-hunt having finished its
course, therefore<a id='t64'></a> an extream
change must be made betwixt
the two farthest extream bells
from it, which are 3.5 (<i>q</i>). The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>treble hunts up (<i>r</i>). The half-hunt
begins its motion again through
the extream bells, and first it
moves up over <i>4th</i> (<i>s</i>). The whole
hunt moves down (<i>t</i>); the half-hunt
must proceed in its course,
and therefore must move over
another note (<i>v</i>). And this method
being observed, will produce
sixscore changes, and then
the bells will in course come
round. Now ’tis observable,
that the changes at (<i>b d f h k m o
q s v x</i> and <i>z</i>), being set down by themselves,
that is, the 1 to be excluded, and the changes
on 2345 to be set directly under one another
in the same successive order as they were
made, it will thereby appear, that those four
figures have made twelve changes of the
twenty four, according to the method of the
first twenty four changes on four bells before
set down. And whereas here are just half
the sixscore changes prickt down, so likewise
here are just half the four and twenty
changes made therein: and the remaining
part of this sixscore being likewise prickt, the
remaining part of this four and twenty
would also appear therein, which part being
added to the former twelve, would make up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>the twenty four changes compleat; and the
method of them the same in all respects with
the first twenty four changes on four bells,

usual and easiest way, is to make them betwixt
the two farthest notes from the half-hunt.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>Whereas the treble or fifth being made
whole-hunts, the first of them can neither be
moved down, nor the last up, at the beginning
of a peal; therefore one of the twenty
four changes must first be made, which is as
effectual, as if the treble had moved down,
or the 5th up.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Learner may observe, that two of the
four and twenty changes are never made together
in any sixscore, but as soon as one is
made, the whole-hunt moves through the
four notes before another can be made.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sixscore changes may be rung one
hundred and sixty ways, which are thus demonstrable.
There are five times four figures
to be produced out of five, and not twice
four the same figures: as 1234. 1235. 1245.
1345. 2345. with each four the twenty four
changes may be prickt sixteen ways, as before
I have shewed on four bells; so that here
will be five times sixteen four and twenties,
which amount to eighty, and not two alike.
Now to each four add the fifth figure which
is wanting, as to 1234 add 5, to 1235 add
4, to 1245 add 3, to 1345 add 2, to 2345
add 1, and every fifth figure being hunted
through the sixteen four and twenties,
which the other four make, as the 5 through
the sixteen four and twenties which the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>1234 make, and the like of the rest, will produce
as many sixscores as there were four and
twenties, that is, 80. Then the whole hunt
may hunt two ways through each four and
twenty, that is, up and down at the beginning,
which doubles the former number, and
makes 160 in the whole.</p>

<p class='c006'>In ringing terms the hunts are named in
short, as in the peals here prickt. The first
which is named is here understood to be the
whole-hunt, and the last the half-hunt. For

the half-hunt; and treble is the whole-hunt,
and fourth the half-hunt, <i>&#38;c.</i></p>

<p class='c016'>There are seven hundred and twenty
changes to be rung of six bells. But the

<p class='c006'>The twenty four changes are thus rung.
The treble must continually hunt through

<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>or lies behind them, an extream
change must then be
made between the two farthest
notes from it. The treble hunts
up (<i>a</i>). A change is made betwixt
the two farthest notes
from it, which are 2.3 (<i>b</i>). The
treble hunts down (<i>c</i>). An extream
change is made betwixt

be continued to the end. Any

<p class='c006'>In the sixscore changes there is a whole-hunt,
a half-hunt, and four extream bells.
The half-hunt and four extream bells do make
the twenty changes in the same manner as
the twenty changes were made upon five bells
with one hunt. <i>page <a href='#Page_61'>61</a>.</i> The whole hunt hath
a continual motion through the other five
notes, and every time it leads and lies behind
them, one of the twenty changes must then
be made. In this example, treble is the
whole-hunt, 2 the half-hunt, and 3456 extream
bells; therefore 23456 must make
the twenty changes wherein 2 is the hunt,
and every time it lies either before the four
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>extream bells, or behind them, an extream
change must then be made, which here shall
be betwixt the two farthest extream bells
from the half-hunt. The treble
hunts up (<i>a</i>). One of the twenty
changes must now be made,
therefore 2 being the hunt in
it, must begin its course
through the extream bells (<i>b</i>).
The treble hunts down (<i>c</i>);
The half-hunt proceeds forward
(<i>d</i>); the treble hunts up
(<i>e</i>); the half-hunt proceeds forward
in its course (<i>f</i>); the treble
hunts down (<i>g</i>); the 2 proceeds
forward (<i>h</i>); the treble
hunts up (<i>i</i>); the half-hunt
should now proceed forward,
but its course through the extream
bells being finished,
therefore an extream change
must be made betwixt 3.4,
which are the two farthest extream
bells from it, (<i>k</i>). The
treble must hunt down (<i>l</i>);
the half-hunt must now go its
course again through the extream
bells, and first it moves
down under the <i>6th</i>, (<i>m</i>) <i>&#38;c.</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>which method must be continued
to the end. Any note
may be made a whole hunt at
pleasure, or a half-hunt also.
And the extream changes may
be made betwixt the two nearest
extream notes to the half-hunt; but withall
observing to make all the extreams in one
peal alike. There are four extream changes
in each peal, and thirty changes distance
from one to another.</p>

<p class='c006'>The method of the Seven hundred and
twenty, hath an absolute dependency upon
the method of the Sixscore changes on five
bells; for five of the notes are to make the
sixscore changes, and the sixth note hunts
continually through them, and every time it
leads or lies behind them, one of the Sixscore
changes must then be made. The method of
the Seven hundred and Twenty is in effect
the same with that of the Sixscore: for as the
Sixscore comprehended the Twenty four
changes on four, and the Six on three; so
likewise the Seven hundred and twenty comprehend
the Sixscore changes on five, the
Twenty four changes on four, and the Six
changes on three. Therefore here must be
three Hunts, and three Extream bells: the
three Hunts are thus distinguished; one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>them is call’d the <i>whole-hunt</i>, another the
<i>half-hunt</i>, and the other the <i>quarter-hunt</i>.
The Half-hunt, Quarter-hunt, and three Extream
bells, are to make the Sixscore changes;
the Quarter-hunt and three Extream
bells are to make the Twenty four changes,
and the three Extream bells are to make the
<i>six</i> changes, which are here also called <i>extream</i>
changes, and made in the same manner
as before I have shewed upon four bells. In
this example here prickt, <i>treble</i> is the <i>whole-hunt</i>,
<i>2d</i> the <i>half-hunt</i>, <i>3d</i> the <i>quarter-hunt</i>,
and <i>4 5 6</i> <i>extream</i> bells. Now ’tis observable,
that 4 5 6 are to make the six <i>extream</i>
changes, which will divide the <i>seven hundred
and twenty</i> into six equal parts; the 3 4 5 6
are to make the <i>twenty four</i> changes, wherein
the <i>3d</i> is the <i>hunt</i>, (but in the <i>seven hundred
and twenty</i> ’tis call’d the <i>quarter-hunt</i>;)
and 2 3 4 5 6 are to make the <i>sixscore</i> changes,
wherein the <i>2d</i> is the <i>whole-hunt</i> (though in
the 720 ’tis call’d the <i>half-hunt</i>,) by which
’tis evident, that the <i>treble</i> continually hunts
through these five 2 3 4 5 6, the <i>2d</i> through
the four 3 4 5 6, and the <i>3d</i> through these
three 4 5 6; which are assigned for the respective
<i>hunts</i> to hunt through, from the beginning
to the end of the peal. First the
<i>treble</i> hunts up (<i>a</i>). Now one of the <i>sixscore</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>changes must be made, therefore
the <i>2d</i> being the <i>hunt</i> in
the <i>sixscore</i>, must begin its
course through the other four
notes (<i>b</i>). The <i>treble</i> hunts
down (<i>c</i>); the <i>2d</i> proceeds in
its course (<i>d</i>); the <i>treble</i> hunts
up (<i>e</i>). The <i>2d</i> proceedeth forward
in its course (<i>f</i>); the <i>treble</i>
hunts down (<i>g</i>); the <i>2d</i>
proceeds forward (<i>h</i>);
the <i>treble</i> hunts up (<i>i</i>); the <i>2d</i>,
which is the <i>half-hunt</i>, should
now proceed forward, but having
finished its course through
the four bells, therefore the <i>3d</i>,
which is the <i>quarter-hunt</i>, must
begin its motion through the
<i>extream</i> bells (<i>k</i>). The <i>treble</i>
hunts down (<i>l</i>). The <i>half-hunt</i>
must now begin its course
again through the four bells,
and first therefore it moves
down under the 6 (<i>m</i>). The
<i>treble</i> must hunt up again, and
then the <i>2d</i> must move down
under another bell, which method
must be observed untill
the <i>2d</i> has moved quite down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>through the four bells again, and then the
<i>3d</i> must proceed forward by moving over another
of the <i>extream</i> bells; which method
must be observed in the motion of the three
<i>hunts</i>, until the <i>quarter-hunt</i> hath moved up
behind the <i>extream</i> bells, and then the <i>whole</i>
and <i>half-hunts</i>, having gone their course again
through the bells, an <i>extream</i> change
must be made: after which the <i>whole</i>, <i>half</i>,
and <i>quarter-hunts</i> proceed again in their
course as before.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>The letter <i>h</i> standing by the figures signifies
<i>half-hunt</i>, that is, the motion of the <i>half-hunt</i>
in that change; and likewise <i>q</i> the <i>quarter-hunt</i>.
Here are the first <i>sixscore</i> changes of
a <i>seven hundred and twenty</i>; wherein ’tis observable,
that all the changes at <i>h</i> and <i>q</i> being
set down by themselves in the same successive
order as they were made, that is, the
1 to be excluded, and the changes on the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>five figures to be set down directly under
one another, and the <i>extream</i> change at
last, it will thereby appear, that the five figures
have made twenty changes of a <i>sixscore</i>,
according to the method of the example on
five bells, <i>page <a href='#Page_63'>63</a>.</i> with this only difference,
these are made on 23456, and those were
made on 12345; but the five figures of each
have both alike course, the <i>2d</i> and <i>3d</i> going
the same course in this, as the <i>treble</i> and <i>2d</i>
did in that. Now whereas the <i>sixscore</i> changes
here prickt down are a sixth part of the
<i>seven hundred</i> and <i>twenty</i>, so likewise are the
<i>twenty changes</i>, here made by 23456, a sixth
part of the <i>sixscore</i>: and then consequently,
the <i>seven hundred</i> and <i>twenty</i> changes being all
prickt, the <i>sixscore</i> changes on 23456 would
plainly appear therein, in the same manner as
twenty of them appear in this <i>sixscore</i>. Therefore
more need not be said of the method
of the 720, since the method of the <i>sixscore</i>
changes on five bells being well understood,
will be a sure and certain guide to the Learner:
only this one thing farther; in ringing
of this peal with any <i>hunts</i>, the second
<i>extream</i> change being made between the two
bells which made the first <i>extream</i>, will always
bring the bells round at the end of the
<i>twelvescore</i>. But after <i>twelvescore</i> are made,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>they cannot in course be brought round until
the end of the 720.</p>

<p class='c006'>The 720 changes may be rung one thousand
nine hundred and twenty several ways,
which is thus demonstrable. There are six
times five figures to be produced out of six,
and not twice five the same: as 12345. 12346.
12356. 12456. 13456. 23456. and with
each five the <i>sixscore</i> changes may be prickt
one hundred and sixty ways, as before I have
shewed on five bells. Now to each five add
the sixth figure which is wanting, as to
12345 add 6, to 12346 add 5, to 12456 add
3, to 13456 add 2, and to 23456 add 1. And
the sixth figure which is added, being hunted
through all the several <i>sixscores</i> which
the other five figures make; for instance, the
6 through the 160 several <i>sixscores</i> which
12345 make, and the 5 also through the
160 several <i>sixscores</i>, which 12346 make, and
the like of the rest; will produce as many
<i>seven hundred</i> and <i>twenties</i> as there are <i>sixscores</i>,
that is, six times one hundred and sixty,
which amounts to nine hundred and sixty.
Then the note that hunts through the other
five, may hunt two ways through each <i>sixscore</i>,
that is, up and down, which will double
the former number, and make nineteen hundred
and twenty in the whole.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'><span class='large'>AN</span> INTRODUCTION<br> <span class='large'>to the Knowledge of</span><br> <i>CROSSE PEALS</i>.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c014'>These Peals are term’d <i>cross</i> in respect of
their intricate methods; wherein several
notes moving at one and the same time,
do thwart or <i>cross</i> each other in their course
and motion, some moving up, others at the
same time down, gives this Denomination
to the Peals. The end of pricking them is
to make the compleat number of changes by
a method differing from that of other Peals.
For although five can be varied but 120
ways, and six but 720 <i>&#38;c.</i> yet the methods
by which they are varied, are differing, according
to the several fancies of the Artist.
And as order and method are the only <i>basis</i>
on which this Art is founded; so the skilful
Artists, the better to effect the aforesaid
end, have thought fit in most peals to appoint
one note to be as it were a Helm or Rudder,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>by which the course of the peal is steered;
which note is term’d a <i>Hunt</i>, and hath one
constant uniform motion throughout the
peal, differing from that of the other notes.
The manner of its motion is continually
through the other notes, that is, from leading
to strike behind, and from thence again to
lead, which motion, first up and then down,
is term’d one compleat Course. Some peals
upon five bells, as <i>old Doubles</i>, <i>&#38;c.</i> consist of
single Courses; there being ten changes in
every single Course, and twelve of those
Courses in the peal. Other peals upon five
bells, as <i>London Paradox</i>, <i>&#38;c.</i> consist of double
Courses; there being twenty changes in
every double Course, and six of those Courses
in the peal. Upon six bells there are also
single and double Courses, <i>viz.</i> twelve changes
in every single Course, as in <i>Grandsire
Bob</i> <i>&#38;c.</i> and twenty four changes in every
double Course, as in <i>Colledg Bob</i>, <i>&#38;c.</i> the
change wherein the <i>Hunt</i> leaves leading being
the first change of every Course. Now
the methods of these peals being well considered,
they will be found more easie than at
the first view they may seem to be; for the
first Course of any Cross Peal being judiciously
viewed, the general method of the
whole peal will thereby appear: for all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Courses in a Cross peal do agree in these
three respects. First, in the motion of the
<i>Hunt</i>; secondly, in the motion of the rest of
the notes; thirdly, in the making of the changes,
which will plainly appear in the following
peals, (some few changes in each peal only
excepted, as hereafter I shall shew in my
Directions to the several peals:) for proof of
which I will give an instance in the peal of
new Doubles upon five bells, these being the
three first Courses of the peal. Wherein ’tis
observable, that the last
change of the first
Course which is 13524,
I have set down again
at the top of the second
Course; and likewise the
last change of the second
Course which is 15432,
I have also put at the
top of the third course;
which I have done for
the plainer Demonstration
of what I here intend. So that the ten
lowermost changes are the ten changes of
each Course.</p>

<p class='c006'>First therefore, as to the motion of the
<i>hunt</i>, the 1 which is the <i>hunt</i> moves directly
up behind, where it lieth twice, and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>down again to lead, where it lieth also twice;
as appears in each of these three Courses, and
the like also throughout the peal.</p>

<p class='c006'>Secondly, as the <i>2d</i>, <i>3d</i>, <i>4th</i>, and <i>5th</i>
bells move through the first Course, so
the bells that lie in the <i>2d</i>, <i>3d</i>, <i>4th</i>, and <i>5th</i>
places in the last change of every course,
moves in the same manner also through the
next following course. For instance; first,
for the bell in the <i>2d</i> place: in the first course
the <i>2d</i> bell moves down to lead, where it lieth
twice, and then dodges untill the <i>treble</i>
comes down to it. So likewise in the second
course, the <i>3d</i> bell lying in the <i>2d</i> place
moves down to lead, where it lies twice, and
then dodges until <i>treble</i> comes down to it;
and also in the third course, the <i>5th</i> bell lying
in the <i>2d</i> place, moves down to lead
where it lieth twice, and dodgeth until the
<i>treble</i> moves down to it. Secondly, for the
bell in the <i>3d</i> place. In the first course the
<i>3d</i> bell moves down to lead, and there dodgeth
untill the <i>treble</i> comes down to it: so
likewise in the second course the <i>5th</i> bell
lying in the <i>3d</i> place moves down to lead, and
there dodgeth untill the <i>treble</i> comes down
to it: and also in the <i>3d</i> course the <i>4th</i> bell
lying in the <i>3d</i> place moves down to lead, and
there dodgeth until the <i>treble</i> comes down to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>it. Thirdly, for the bell in the fourth place:
In the first course, the fourth bell moves up
behind, then down into the <i>3d</i> place where
it lieth twice, then up again behind; so likewise
in the second course, the <i>2d</i> bell lying
in the <i>4th</i> place moves up behind, then down
into the <i>3d</i> place where it lieth twice, then
up again behind; and also in the third course
the <i>3d</i> bell lying in the <i>4th</i> place, moves therefore
up behind, then down into the <i>3d</i> place
where it lieth twice, then up again behind.
And such uniform motion also hath the bell
in the <i>5th</i> place through every course.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thirdly, that the changes in all the courses
of the peal are made alike, will here also
plainly appear in the three courses. For the
first change of every course is made on the
two first and two last bells; the second change
of every course is made on the four last;
the third is made on the four first; the fourth
on the two first and two last; the fifth on the
four first; the sixth on the two first and two
last; the seventh on the four first; the eighth
on the four last; the ninth on the two first and
two last; and the tenth single.</p>

<p class='c006'>And thus in every Cross-peal the Courses
do all agree, first in the motion of the Hunt,
secondly in the motion of the rest of the
notes, and thirdly in the making of the changes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>as before I have showed. So that these
three things being well observed, will be very
helpful both in pricking and ringing them;
the first and third being most proper to direct
the pricking of them, and the first and
second the ringing of them. Therefore if
the Practitioner do but observe how the
changes are made in the first course of a peal,
wherein he must have particular regard to
the motion of the Hunt, (with<a id='t86'></a> a little further
help from the following directions to
each peal, as to the making of <i>Extreams</i> and
Bob-changes) he may easily prick down all
the following Courses of the same peals and
therefore in the following peals I have onely
prickt down two or three of the first courses
for an example, and then have abridged the
rest of the peal by setting down only the
changes that are made at the leadings of the
Hunt. But note, there are some few <i>Cambridg</i>-peals
upon five bells, wherein all the
courses of each peal do not agree in the aforesaid
three respects: For although as to the
motion of the <i>whole-hunt</i> they do, yet in the
motion of the rest of the notes, and consequently
in the making of the changes they do
not.</p>

<p class='c006'>It being very difficult to begin the following
peals with cross <i>hunts</i>, that is, to make the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span><i>2d</i>, <i>3d</i>, <i>4th</i> <i>&#38;c.</i> whole-hunts, I will therefore
set down a general rule for making the
first changes at the beginning of each Peal,
wherein consists the great difficulty. In any
Cross-peal the <i>whole-hunt</i> may move either
up or down at the beginning; and the motion
of the <i>whole-hunt</i> in the first course of each
of the following peals will direct the first motion
of any cross <i>hunt</i>, and consequently of
making the first changes in that peal. For Example,
admit the <i>4th</i> were made the <i>whole-hunt</i>
in the peal called <i>Old doubles and singles</i>
upon five bells, and to <i>hunt</i> up at first: now to
know how to make the first changes, observe
how the change is made wherein the treble
(which is there the <i>whole-hunt</i>) moves up out
of the <i>4th</i> place, and in the same manner must
the change be made wherein the <i>4th</i> bell also
moves up out of that place: therefore as
the change wherein the treble moves up out
of the <i>4th</i> place is a <i>single</i> behind; so likewise
must the change wherein the <i>4th</i> bell
moves up out of that place, be also a <i>single</i> behind
thus, 12354: and then as the next
change wherein the treble lieth still behind
is double of the four first bells; so likewise
the next change wherein the <i>4th</i> bell lieth
still behind, must also be made on the four
first, thus, 21534, <i>&#38;c.</i> Or admit the <i>4th</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>were to hunt down at the beginning, then
observe how the change is made wherein the
treble hunts down out of the <i>4th</i> place, and
so in like manner must the change be made
wherein the <i>4th</i> hunts also down out of that
place: therefore as the change wherein the
treble hunts down out of the <i>4th</i> place, is
double of the four first bells; so likewise must
the change wherein the <i>4th</i> bell hunts down
out of that place, be also double of the four
first thus, 21435; then as the <i>treble</i> makes a
<i>single</i> when it moves down out of the <i>3d</i>
place, so likewise must the <i>4th</i> next make a
single change in moving down out of the <i>3d</i>
place thus 24135, <i>&#38;c.</i> which observations
will guide the making of the first changes
in any cross peal with any Hunts; but observe
whensoever the first change of any peal
happens<a id='t88'></a> to be single, it must be made at the
back-stroke to prevent cutting compass; and
the like when a double change happens first
in a peal of Triples and Doubles. And moreover
by the way observe, that all the following
peals are so prickt, that in ringing them
at half-pulls, if the first change of each peal is
made at the fore-stroke, the single changes
in each peal will always be made at the back-stroke;
and also the double changes in Triples
and Doubles, excepting some few Single
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>in two or three peals. But when it happens
that the first change of a peal is made at the
back-stroke, then consequently the bells at
the end of the peal will come round at a fore-stroke
change.</p>

<p class='c006'>In such peals on five bells where <i>singles</i> are
made in the <i>3d</i> and <i>4th</i> places at the leadings
of the <i>whole-hunt</i>, the <i>extreams</i> may there be
made three ways in each peal; <i>viz.</i> every
time the <i>half-hunt</i> lieth next to the <i>whole-hunt</i>;
secondly, every time it lieth behind; thirdly,
every time the <i>half-hunt</i> lieth next the
<i>whole-hunt</i>, and also behind: in this last way
there are six <i>extreams</i> in each peal, but in
other ways only three in each; the <i>extreams</i>
being always made when the <i>whole-hunt</i>
leads, and betwixt the two farthest <i>extream</i>
bells from the <i>half-hunt</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>In such peals upon five bells wherein there
are three <i>extreams</i>, and made in the <i>3d</i> and
<i>4th</i> places at the leadings of the <i>whole-hunt</i>;
the rest of the <i>singles</i> at the leadings of the
<i>whole-hunt</i> may be made two ways in each
peal, <i>viz.</i> either in the <i>2d</i> and <i>3d</i>, or the <i>4th</i>
and <i>5th</i> places; if they are made in the <i>2d</i> and
<i>3d</i>, then the <i>extreams</i> must be made when
the <i>half-hunt</i> lyeth behind; but if the <i>singles</i>
are made behind, then the <i>extreams</i> must be
made when the <i>half-hunt</i> lieth next the <i>whole-hunt</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>the <i>extreams</i> being always made between
the two next <i>extream</i> bells to the <i>half-hunt</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>In all the following peals the figures standing
by themselves at the title of the peal, are
the <i>hunts</i> in the peal there prickt: for instance,
in the first <i>cross-peal</i> upon five bells
call’d <i>Old doubles and singles</i>, the two figures
standing thus <i>1 and 2</i>, are the <i>hunts</i> in that
peal; 1 is the <i>whole-hunt</i>, 2 the <i>half-hunt</i>, and
the like of the rest.</p>

<p class='c006'>All peals of <i>doubles</i> upon five bells, which
go sixty changes compleat without any <i>single</i>,
by making of two <i>extreams</i> they will go 120.
And also all peals of <i>doubles</i> upon six bells,
and <i>triples</i> and <i>doubles</i> upon six, which go
360 changes without any <i>single</i> or <i>extreme</i>,
by making of two <i>extreams</i> they will go 720.
The <i>extreams</i> in all these compleat peals proceeding
from one and the same cause, are
therefore to be made after one manner, according
to this general and infallible rule:
Wheresoever any two of the <i>extream</i> bells
are in course to make a change, those two
bells by lying still will effectually make the
<i>extream</i>. So that the making of the <i>extream</i>
in <i>doubles</i> upon five bells, necessitates the making
of a <i>single change</i> at the same time, by
reason that the two <i>extream</i> bells which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>should contribute to the making of the <i>double</i>
change, do lie still; so that the <i>single</i>
change is accidental, and very improperly
called the <i>extream</i>. When the <i>extreams</i> in
<i>triples</i> and <i>doubles</i> upon six bells are made at
<i>double</i> changes, then there happens two <i>singles</i>
in the peal; but when they are made at <i>triple</i>
changes, then those two changes will become
<i>double</i>, and consequently the 720 will then
go compleat without any <i>single</i>. Upon five
bells the first <i>extream</i> must be made within
sixty changes from the beginning, and the
second <i>extream</i> just sixty changes from the
first. Upon six bells the first <i>extream</i> must be
made within 360 changes from the beginning,
and the second <i>extream</i> just 360 changes
from the first. The easiest way in practice,
is to make the <i>extremes</i> at the leadings
of the <i>whole-hunt</i>; wherein it may be observed
as a general rule, That in all peals upon
six bells, where the <i>half-hunt</i> dodgeth behind
at the <i>bobs</i>, there the first <i>extream</i> may be
made either the first, second, or third time:
the <i>half</i> and <i>quarter-hunts</i> dodg together behind,
and then the second <i>extream</i> must be
made the third time those two bells dodg again
together behind, after the first <i>extream</i>
is made. And also in all such peals upon six
bells, where the <i>doubles</i> at the leadings of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span><i>whole-hunt</i> are made on the four middle bells,
there the first <i>extream</i> may be made either
the first, second, or third time the <i>half</i> and
<i>quarter-hunts</i> do make a change in the <i>2d</i> and
<i>3d</i> places, and then the <i>2d</i> <i>extream</i> must be
made the third time those two bells come
there again to make a change after the first
<i>extream</i> is made. The <i>singles</i> at all these <i>extreams</i>
must be made by the <i>half</i> and <i>quarter-hunt</i>.
The first <i>extream</i> in any peal may also
be made at any place, where two of the <i>extream</i>
bells are in course to made a change
according to the preceding general rule; and
then the making of the second <i>extream</i> may
be guided by observations taken from the
changes at the leadings of the <i>whole-hunt</i>: for
at the leadings of the <i>whole-hunt</i> the <i>half</i> and
<i>quarter-hunts</i> always come together to make
a change in one place, just at 120 changes distance
from one another throughout each
peal. Now as the second <i>extream</i> must be
made just 360 changes from the first, so the
making of it may thus be guided: Look how
many changes, or else how many leadings of
the <i>whole-hunt</i> the first <i>extream</i> is made after
the <i>half</i> and <i>quarter-hunts</i> have made a change
together, so many changes or leadings of the
<i>whole-hunt</i> must the second <i>extream</i> be made,
after the third following time that those two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>bells do made a change in the same place again.
And likewise in all peals, where there
are single and double <i>bobs</i>, the same observations
will also hold good, in making the <i>extreams</i>
either after the single or double <i>bobs</i>
as before; there being likewise 120 changes
distance between the single <i>bobs</i> and also between
the double <i>bobs</i>: so that if the first <i>extream</i>
is made at a single <i>bob</i>, the second must
then be made at the third following single
<i>bob</i>, and the like also at double <i>bobs</i>. And
such kind of observations, according to the
nature of the peal, will guide the making of
the second <i>extream</i> in any peal, either upon
five or six bells. Wherein ’tis observable,
that the second <i>extream</i> must always be made
by the same two bells, and in the same place
where the first was made, which two bells
will in course lie apt for that purpose; and
the rest of the bells will also in course lie in
the same places at the second <i>extream</i> where
they lay at the first. After the making of the
first <i>extream</i>, the method of the peal goeth on
as if no <i>extream</i> had been made; and also after
the making of the second <i>extream</i> if any
remaineth, it also goes on, until in course the
bells come round.</p>

<p class='c006'>In all compleat peals of <i>doubles</i> upon six
bells there may also moveable <i>extreams</i> be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>made, which are made according to this rule;
wheresoever any two of the <i>extream</i> bells are
together, and in course to lie still, those two
bells by making a change will thereby make
the <i>extream</i>, which is as effectual as the fixed
<i>extream</i>, the reason and ground of both being
one and the same. There are also two of
these <i>extreams</i> in the peal, and the second
always made 360 changes from the first, and
the making of it guided by such kind of observations
as before. When moveable <i>extreams</i>
are made, then there will be two triple
changes in the 720; but when fixed <i>extreams</i>
are made, then two <i>singles</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>The art of <i>cross-pricking</i> may receive a being
from this consideration. As every compleat
peal of plain changes upon one number
comprehends the compleat peals on all lesser
numbers; so likewise every compleat <i>cross-peal</i>
must of necessity do the like, although
their cross course permits it not to be done so
regularly and demonstrably as the former.
From whence may be inferr’d, that every
note in a <i>cross-peal</i> must of necessity lie as many
times in one place, as the rest of the notes
are capable of making changes; and also that
two or more of the notes must jointly lie in
the same places as many times, as the remaining
number are also capable of making changes:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>this being a certain touchstone to prove
all <i>cross-peals</i> after they are prickt, and must
be held as a principle on which to ground
such methods of pricking, that the course of
all the notes may demonstrably tend to produce
those effects. And from hence it is,
that the whole <i>hunt</i> immediately derives the
manner of its uniform motion through the
courses of each peal. And the changes in
every course are as so many guides to conduct
the rest of the notes in such sort, that
they may be prepared to lie at the last change
of the course in apt places for each succeeding
course to receive them, and to perform
the like. Now as the changes in all the courses
of a peal are made alike, except as before;
so in the composing of <i>cross-peals</i>, by pricking
of one course may soon be discovered, whether
or no a compleat Peal will from thence
arise.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are three ways to make the
<i>extream</i> changes. First, every time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>the <i>hunt</i> leads, as in the peal here prickt; secondly,
every time it lies behind; thirdly,
every time it leads and lies behind: in this
last way there are six <i>extream</i> changes in the
peal, but in the other two ways, only three
<i>extreams</i>; the <i>extream</i> changes must always
be made betwixt the two farthest bells from
the <i>hunt</i>. Any bell may <i>hunt</i> at pleasure,
and it may move either up or down at the beginning
of the peal. If the <i>1st</i><a id='t97a'></a> or <i>3d</i> do <i>hunt</i>
down, or the <i>2d</i> or <i>4th</i> up at the beginning,
the first change must be <i>single</i>, and made of
the back-stroke (if ’tis rung at half-pulls) to
prevent cutting compass; but if either of
those bells<a id='t97'></a> do <i>hunt</i> the contrary way, then the
first change must be double.</p>

<h4 class='c019'><i>Old Doubles and Singles. 1 and 2.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>One change is <i>double</i>, the next <i>single</i>,
and so by turns. The treble hath a
direct hunting course, as in plain changes.
Every <i>double</i> change is on the four first bells,
and the treble is one of the two bells that
makes every <i>single</i> change, except when it
leads, and then the <i>single</i> is in the <i>3d</i> and <i>4th</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>places; but when 2 lies next the treble, then
the <i>single</i> is behind, which is call’d <i>extream</i>.
Every time the treble leaves leading, the
two first bells continue slow dodging, until
the treble comes down and displaceth them.
And when the treble moves down out of the
<i>5th</i> place, the bell that
comes into it lies still
there, untill the treble
comes thither again, except
when the <i>extream</i>
change is made behind.
Every bell lies twice together
in the <i>3d</i> and <i>4th</i>
places, except when the
treble leads, and also
when it hinders them in
hunting.</p>

<p class='c006'>This old peal may be

<h4 class='c019'>London <i>Paradox. 1 and 2.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>One change is <i>double</i>,
the next <i>single</i>, and so by
turns. The motion of the treble
is after this manner; in
hunting up, first, it makes a
dodg in the <i>2d</i> and <i>3d</i> places,
then it lies twice in the <i>4th</i>
place, and four times behind;
in which manner also it hunts
down again, and then leads
four times. The rest of the
bells have a like course and motion
with that of the treble,
untill the treble leads. Now
’tis observable, that every <i>single</i>
change is made in the <i>2d</i>
and <i>3d</i> places until the treble
leads, and then in the <i>3d</i> and
<i>4th</i> places; but when 2 lies
next the treble, then an <i>extream</i>
behind. The changes

dependency upon the course of the

many ways as in that peal, which are here

<p class='c016'>One change is <i>double</i>, the next <i>single</i>,
and so by turns. The motion of the
<i>whole-hunt</i> is after this manner: first, it moves
up into the <i>2d</i> and <i>3d</i> places, lying twice in
each; then it moves up and makes a dodg behind,
and then lieth still one change in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span><i>5th</i> place; then it makes another dodg behind,
and so moves down into the <i>3d</i> and <i>2d</i>
places lying twice in each as before, and then
leads four times. Every other bell hath a
like course and motion with that of the treble
until the leadings of the treble, and then
observe, that every time the treble goeth to
lead and leaves leading, the <i>double</i> change is
made on the two first and two last bells, except
when it goeth to lead if the <i>half-hunt</i> lies
next it, and then not. Every bell leads four
times, and every <i>single</i> is made behind. The
change wherein each bell leaves leading, is
always made on the four first bells, except as
before.</p>

from leading the two first bells dodg until it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>comes down again and displaceth them; and
whilst they dodg before, every bell that
comes down into the <i>3d</i> place lies there
twice, and then moves up again behind. But
after the dodging all the bells go a direct
hunting course up and down, until the dodging
again hindreth them as before. Every
bell lies twice behind,
except when the treble
leaves leading if the <i>2d</i>
lies next it, and then
the <i>double</i> is made on the
two first and two last
bells; by which means
the two hind-bells then
make a dodg, which
happens in course once
in twenty changes, that
is, every second time
the treble leaves leading.
By this method it will
go sixty changes, and
then an <i>extream</i> must be
made. The <i>extreams</i> in
this peal may be made
according to the preceding general rule set
down in the <i>Introduction</i>. Here the first <i>extream</i>
is made at the end of sixty changes, the
bells lying 1 3 2; and when they come to lie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>so again, the second <i>extream</i> must be made;
the <i>extream</i> is made behind, two of the <i>extream</i>
bells lying there, and the <i>single</i> is made
in the <i>2d</i> and <i>3d</i> place at both the <i>extreams</i>.</p>

<h4 class='c019'><i>Grandsire. 1 and 5.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>The treble hath a direct hunting course
as in plain changes, and every other bell
hath also a like hunting course with that of
the treble except when the <i>bobs</i> hinder. The
<i>bobs</i> are double changes, and made on the
two first and two last bells according to this
rule, <i>viz.</i> every time the <i>treble</i> goes to lead
and leaves leading, a <i>bob</i>-change is then made,
except the <i>5th</i> lying next it makes a change
there with it, and then not. Now ’tis observable,
that once in twenty changes, that is,
at every second leading of the treble, the <i>5th</i>
lies next it, and consequently there is but
one <i>bob</i>-change then to be made, but at other
times two; so that at one leading of the treble
there is but one <i>bob</i>-change made, at the
next leading there are two, and so successively
by turns, which for distinction may be
call’d <i>single</i> and <i>double bobs</i>, The two bells
that dodg behind at a <i>bob</i> continue there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>dodging until the treble comes up and displaceth
them, and at every <i>bob-change</i> the
bell in the <i>3d</i> place lieth
still, and then moves
down to lead. By this
method it will go sixty
changes; and to carry on
the course <i>extreams</i> must
be made, there being
two in the peal. The
manner of making an <i>extream</i>
I have at large
shewed in the <i>Introduction</i>,
and the <i>extreams</i>
may here be made in any
place according to the
general rule there set
down. The easiest way
in practice is to make
them at the leadings of
the treble; at any single
<i>bob</i> it maybe made behind,
two of the <i>extream</i>
bells lying there, and to
lie still whilst the bells
in the <i>2d</i> and <i>3d</i> places
do make the <i>single</i> change: at any double <i>bob</i>
it may be made in the <i>2d</i> and <i>3d</i> places, so
that the <i>single</i> must there be made behind.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>If the first <i>extream</i> is made at the single <i>bob</i>,
the second must be made at the third following
single <i>bob</i>; or if the first is made at a
double <i>bob</i>, the second must be made at the
third double <i>bob</i> following, as in this peal
here prickt, where the first <i>extream</i> is made
at a double <i>bob</i>, and the second also made
at the third following double <i>bob</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>This peal will go with any <i>hunts</i>, and to begin
it on the four hind bells; but then in
ringing it at half-pulls, the first change being
made at back-stroke to prevent cutting compass,
the bells at the end of the peal will come
round at a fore-stroke change. Therefore
the better way is to begin it on the four first
bells, which may also be done with any <i>hunts</i>,
excepting 1.3, 1.5. and 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, wherein
the first change of each may be a <i>bob</i>. And
observe, that in any way of beginning it, the
bells must all proceed in such a perfect hunting
course as the first change directs them,
until the first <i>bob</i> comes to be made.</p>

<h4 class='c019'><i>Old Triples and Doubles.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>One change is <i>triple</i>, the next <i>double</i>,
and so by turns, except one <i>single</i> at
the end of every sixty changes. Every <i>triple</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>change is made on the two first, the two middle,
and two last bells; and every <i>double</i> is
made on the four middle bells, except when
the <i>hunt</i> leads and then on the four hind bells.
Treble is here the <i>hunt</i>, and hath a direct
hunting course up and down as in plain changes:
the rest of the bells have also a direct
hunting course up and down except when the
treble leads, and then each bell that was
hunting up (except that in the <i>2d</i> place)
makes a dodge with the next bell below it,
and then proceeds forward again in its course
up; and each bell which at the same time was
hunting down, makes a dodg with the next
bell above it, and so proceedeth forward in
its course down; which method will carry on
the peal five <i>courses</i> of the <i>hunt</i>, that is sixty
changes as they are here prickt.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the 120 there is also a
<i>half-hunt</i>; and when the
<i>whole-hunt</i> leads and the <i>half-hunt</i>
lies next it, a single
change must then be made,
either in the <i>3d</i> and <i>4th</i>, or
<i>5th</i> and <i>6th</i> places; but observing
when the <i>half-hunt</i>
comes again to lie next the
<i>whole-hunt</i>, another single
change must be made in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>same place where the first
was made. These single
changes are called <i>extreams</i>,
there being two in every
<i>sixscore</i>, and the last of them
always falls out in course to
be made just 60 changes
from the first, that is, at the
fifth leading of the whole
<i>hunt</i> after the first <i>extream</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the 240 there is also a

change being then made in
the <i>4th</i> and <i>5th</i> places, will bring the bells
round at <i>twelvescore</i>, there being four <i>singles</i>
in the peal, one of which falls in the course at

<p class='c006'>In the 720 there is a whole, half, and quarter

happen at the end of every <i>twelvescore</i>)
then the <i>single</i> must be made behind, which

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>The <i>sevenscore and four</i> triples and doubles

when the 2 lies next the treble, an <i>extream</i> is
made in the <i>4th</i> and <i>5th</i> places. This peal is
grounded on the <i>twenty four</i> doubles and singles,
the four middle bells making them at
the leadings of the treble.</p>

<h4 class='c019'><i>Grandsire Bob. 1, 2 and 4.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>The general method of this peal is the
same with that next before, but with
this difference; whereas in that peal <i>singles</i>
were made at the end of every sixty changes
to carry on the course, in this there are <i>double</i>
changes made in their stead, which are
called <i>Bob</i>-changes, and made when the treble
leads in the <i>2d</i> and <i>3d</i> and the <i>5th</i> and <i>6th</i>
places, whereas at other times the <i>double</i> is
there made on the four hind bells.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Practitioner may observe these rules
in the ringing of it, <i>viz.</i> whatsoever bells he
followeth when he hunteth up, he must follow
the same bells again, and in the same order,
the next time he hunts down, as in these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>changes here prickt; where the treble in hunting
up first follows 2, then 4, and then 6;
and when it comes behind, first it follows 2
again, then in its hunting down it follows 4
and 6 in the same order as when it hunted
up; which is also observed in the ringing of
any other bell, but with this difference betwixt
the <i>whole-hunt</i> and the rest of the bells,
<i>viz.</i> Every time the <i>whole-hunt</i> leaves the <i>treble’s</i>
place and hunts up, it followeth different
bells from what it did in its former hunting
up, as may be seen in this example:
where in its first hunting up it first
follows 2, then 4, then 6; whereas in
the next hunting up it first follows
3, then 2, then 4. But the first time
any other bell leads after a <i>bob</i>,
whatsoever bells it then follows in
its hunting up, it follows the same
bells likewise and in the same order
every time it hunts up, and consequently
every time it hunts down
unto the next <i>bob</i>; as in this example,
where 2 in its first hunting up,
first follows 4, then 6, then 5, and
likewise when it next hunts up it
follows 465 as before, <i>&#38;c.</i> But
when the <i>whole-hunt</i> is the second
bell which he follows in hunting up,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>he must follow it again when he next lies

infallible rule, by which he that rings the <i>half-hunt</i>
may always give notice of the <i>bobs</i> as
well when the peal is inverted, as in the ordinary
way of ringing it. The <i>bobs</i> fall out in
course single and double, the one single, the
next double; and so by turns; there being
three single <i>bobs</i> and three double <i>bobs</i> in the
<i>eighteenscore</i>, and consequently six of each in
the 720.</p>

<p class='c006'>The aforesaid method being observed, will
carry on the course of the peal to the end of
<i>eighteenscore</i>, which is just half the 720, and
then it terminates, as appears in the <i>eighteenscore</i>
here prickt: but by making an <i>extream</i>
that number may be doubled; for then
<i>eighteenscore</i> changes more will go in course
according to the former method; and another
<i>extream</i> being likewise made at the end of
the last <i>eighteenscore</i> will compleat the 720.
The manner of making an <i>extream</i> I have
shewed at large in the <i>Introduction</i>, <i>page <a href='#Page_90'>90</a>.</i>
where I have also set down a general rule
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>for making them, to which I refer.</p>

<p class='c006'>The first <i>extream</i> may be made either the
first, second, or third time that the half and
quarter <i>hunts</i> dodg behind; or else at the
first, second, or third single <i>bob</i>; at either of
which places the <i>single</i> must be made behind.</p>

and so by turns. The treble hath a direct
hunting course up
and down as in plain
changes, and every time
it goeth to lead and

two first and two last
bells, the rest of the <i>double</i>
changes are on the
four first. The treble is
one of the two bells that
makes every <i>single</i> change
except when it leads, and
then the <i>single</i> is made in
the <i>3d</i> and <i>4th</i> places;
but when the 2 lies next
the 1, then an <i>extream</i> is made behind. When
the treble leaves the two first bells, they continue
slow dogding until treble comes down
and displaceth them. Every bell (except
the treble) lieth twice in the <i>3d</i> place.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the treble leaves
the two hind bells, they
continue dodging untill
it comes up again and
displaceth them, and
then they hunt directly
down; the first to lead,
and the other into the
<i>2d</i> place: that which
moves to lead, having
lead four times, gives
place to the treble; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>when the Treble hath done leading it takes
the treble’s place again, and leads four times
more and then hunts directly up; the other
bell which moved down into the <i>2d</i> place lies
there twice, and then the Treble in hunting
down moves it into the <i>3d</i> place where it lies
still, untill the Treble in hunting up moves it
back into the <i>2d</i> place, where having lain
twice it hunteth up. This Peal is as musical,
easie, and practical as any of this kind that
ever was prickt.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>The Faulcon. 1 and 2.</i></h3>

<p class='c016'>This Peal consists most of <i>double</i> changes.
The treble hath a direct hunting course
as in plain changes, and every time it hunts
up and down it makes a <i>single</i> in the <i>3d</i>
and <i>4th</i> places, and when it leads a <i>single</i> is
also made there, but when 2 lies next it the
<i>extream</i> is made behind. When the treble
leaves the two first bells they continue there
until it comes down again and displaceth
them, but observe, when the treble moves into
the <i>5th</i> place, and again from thence, the
<i>double</i> is on the two first and two last bells,
by means of which the two first bells then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>dodg, but before and after they lie still. Every
bell lies twice in the <i>3d</i> place and then
hunts up, except that which lies there when
the treble leaves leading.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this and the former peal the <i>singles</i> may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>be made in another manner, <i>viz.</i> when the
<i>whole-hunt</i> leads, and the <i>half-hunt</i> lieth either
in the <i>4th</i> or <i>5th</i> places, a <i>single</i> must
then be made betwixt the two next bells to
the <i>half-hunt</i>; but at other times a <i>double</i>
change to be made when the <i>whole-hunt</i> leads,
as in the former way.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>Stedman’s <i>Principle</i>.</h3>

<p class='c016'>The changes are all <i>double</i>, two <i>singles</i>
excepted. One <i>double</i> is made on the
two first and two last bells, the next on the
four last, and so by turns successively; excepting
every sixth change, which is <i>double</i> on
the four first bells, and for distinction is called
a <i>Parting</i> change. All the bells have a like
course. The general method is this; the
three first bells go the <i>six</i> changes, and the
two hind-bells in the mean time dodg; then
a <i>Parting</i> change is made which parts the
two hind-bells, moving that in the fourth
place down into the <i>3d</i>, and that in the <i>3d</i>
place up into the <i>4th</i>, and then the three first
bells go the <i>six</i> again, the two hind-bells in
in the mean time dodging as before; and then
another <i>Parting</i> change is made, and so successively
on. Every bell that comes behind
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>continues there dodging six changes with one
bell and six with another, and then in course
the <i>Parting</i> change brings it down. One <i>six</i>
cuts compass, the next doth not, and so by
turns successively. In the <i>six</i> which cut compass
the two first bells of the three makes the
first change of it, but in the other the two
last of the three. By this method the peal
will go sixty changes, and to carry it on farther
<i>extreams</i> must be made. An <i>extream</i> is
made by the lying still of two bells when in
course they should make a change, as before
I have shewed more fully in the <i>Introduction</i>,
<i>page <a href='#Page_90'>90</a>.</i> but withall observing, that whereas
in this peal the bells have all a like course,
therefore they may all be termed <i>extream</i>
bells, and consequently the <i>extreams</i> to be
made according to this general rule, <i>viz.</i> the
first <i>extream</i> may be made by any two bells
that are in course to make a change within
the compass of the first sixty changes of the
peal; and the second <i>extream</i> must be made
according to this rule. Whatsoever two bells
are dodging behind at the first <i>extream</i>, when
the same two bells come to dodg there again,
is a certain warning for the second <i>extream</i>
to be then made. And observe, how many
changes the first <i>extream</i> is made from a <i>parting</i>
change; so many likewise must the last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span><i>extream</i> be made after a <i>Parting</i> change also.
And the <i>single</i> and <i>extream</i> comes in course
each of them to be made in the same place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>and by the same bells at the last <i>extream</i>, as
they were at the first. Here the <i>singles</i> are
made behind, and the <i>extreams</i> in the <i>2d</i> and
<i>3d</i> places; and as the <i>4th</i> and <i>5th</i> bells do
dodg behind at the first <i>extream</i>, so likewise
when they come to dodg there again, the second
<i>extream</i> is then made, the treble leading
at both of them, as appeareth in the peal
here prickt.</p>

dodg until the Treble displaceth them.
The Treble is one of the bells which maketh

each; then having made

so hunts down in the

up, and then leads
four times. When the
Treble moves down out
of the fifth place, the
two hind-bells dodge untill
it comes up there
again; during which
time the bell in the <i>4th</i>

when the Treble moves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>up out of the second place, each bell that
comes there lieth four times, until the Treble
comes down there again. Every <i>single</i> is
made behind. By this method it will go
120 changes; and by making of <i>bobs</i> it will
go 240, 360, or 270. At the <i>bobs</i> the bell
in the <i>2d</i> place always lieth still.</p>

<i>2d</i> and <i>3d</i> places where it
makes a dodg every time it
hunts up and down. Every
other bell hath the same
course with the <i>whole-hunt</i>;
but observing, when they
come down and have made a
<i>dodg</i> in the second and third
places, they lie still one
change in the second place,
and then make another <i>dodg</i>
there, and so hunt up as the
Treble did. But note, when
the Treble goeth to lead and
leaves leading, the bells in
the third and fourth places
lie still. Every <i>single</i> is made
in the second and third places,
and every bell lieth four
times behind. By this method
it will go 120, and by
making of <i>bobs</i> it will go 240,
360, or 720. At the <i>bob</i>-change,
the bell in the <i>4th</i>
place always lieth still.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>In the 180 and 360, the 6 may

<p class='c006'>By making of two <i>extreams</i>
the 360 may be doubled; they

<p class='c016'>The Treble is the <i>whole-hunt</i>; and hath a
direct hunting course. When it moves
down out of the fifth place the two hind-bells
dodg until it comes there again, during

first bells make a change; but at other times
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>the leading bell lieth still. By this method
it will go <i>sixty</i> changes, and by making of
<i>bobs</i> it will go 120, 180, or 360. At the

lieth still. The warning for the <i>bobs</i> in
the 120, 180, and 360, is the same with that
in <i>Colledge Doubles</i>, <i>p. <a href='#Page_143'>143</a>.</i> By making of two

<p class='c006'>To ring 120. Every
time the <i>half-hunt</i> maketh
a change next the <i>whole-hunt</i>,
a <i>bob</i> must then be
made, as in this here
prickt, where 2 is the
<i>half-hunt</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>To ring 180.  Every
time the <i>half</i> and <i>quarter-hunts</i>
make a change together
next  the <i>whole-hunt</i>,
a <i>bob</i> must then be
made.</p>

<p class='c006'>To ring 360. Every
time the <i>half-hunt</i> maketh
a change next the <i>whole-hunt</i>
a <i>bob</i> must then be
made, except when a <i>quarter-hunt</i>
makes a change
there with it, and then
not.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the  180 and 360
2 and 4 may be the <i>half</i>
and <i>quarter-hunts</i> or others
at pleasure. The
two <i>extreams</i> in the 720
must be made according
to the rule in the <i>Introduction</i>.
The first <i>extream</i> may be made either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>first, second, or third time that the
<i>half</i> and <i>quarter-hunts</i> make a change together
in the second and third places at the leading
of the <i>whole-hunt</i>; and then the second
<i>extream</i> must be made the third time following
that those two bells make a change there
again, the <i>extreams</i> being there made in
the fourth and fifth places, and the <i>singles</i> in
the second and third places.</p>

<p class='c006'>Every time the Treble leads, the <i>double</i>
may as well be made on the four hind-bells,
and the <i>bobs</i> to be made as before; but the
warning for them the same with <i>Colledge Doubles</i>.</p>

<h4 class='c019'><i>Five Colledge Bobs.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>In these five peals, the Treble is the <i>whole-hunt</i>,
and hath a like dodging course in
all of them. The general method of the five
peals is as follows: <i>viz.</i></p>

<p class='c006'><i>Colledge Bob the first.</i> When the Treble
moves down out of the fifth place, the two
hind bells dodg until it comes there again.
Every bell leads twice, and then hunts up into
the fourth place, unless the dodging course
of the Treble hinders it, where it lieth twice
and then moves down again; except the bell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>that dodged with the Treble before, and also
that which leads when the Treble lieth still
behind, both which hunt directly up. When
the Treble moves down from dodging in the
third and fourth places, the bell that dodged
there with it continues in those two places,
lying twice together in each by turns until
the Treble comes to dodg there with it again.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Colledge Bob the second.</i> Every bell when it
comes to lead makes a dodg before, then it lyeth
still one change, then it makes another
dodg, and so moves up into the fourth place
where it lieth still twice, and then down again;
except it dodgeth with the Treble in
the fourth place, and then it hunts up behind.
But when the Treble moves down out of the
third place, the two bells in the third and
fourth places continue there until the Treble
comes up there again, during which time the
two hind-bells dodg.</p>

<p class='c006'><i>Colledge Bob the third.</i> When the Treble
leaves leading, the two first bells dodg until
it comes to lead again; except when the Treble
dodgeth behind, for then the two first bells
lie still. When the Treble leaves the two
hind-bells, they lie still one change, dodg
the next, and so by turns until the treble
comes there again. The two middle bells always
dodg until the Treble hindereth them.</p>

When the Treble leaves the
two hind bells, they dodg
until it comes there again.
And when it leaves the two
first bells they lie still one
change, dodg the next, and
so by turns until it comes
down there again; during
which time the bells in the
third and fourth places dodg
except when the Treble hindereth
them.</p>

<p class='c006'>By these methods each of
them will go 120 changes,
and by making of <i>bobs</i> they
will go 240, 360, or 720.
In the first of them the bell
in the second place lieth still
at the <i>bob</i>-changes, and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>the other four the bell in the fourth place always
lieth still.</p>

<p class='c006'>To ring 240. Every time the <i>half-hunt</i>
dodgeth behind a <i>bob</i> must then be made, as
in these peals here prickt; where, in the first
peal the 4 is the <i>half-hunt</i>, and in the other
four peals the 2 is the <i>half-hunt</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>To ring 360. Every time the <i>half</i> and
<i>quarter-hunts</i> dodg together behind, a <i>bob</i>
must then be made.</p>

<p class='c006'>To ring 720. Every time the <i>half-hunt</i>
dodgeth behind a <i>bob</i> must then be made, except
when the <i>quarter-hunt</i> dodgeth there
with it, and then not.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the 360 or 720 of each peal the 2 may
be the <i>half-hunt</i>, and 4 the <i>quarter-hunt</i> or
others at pleasure.</p>

<h4 class='c019'><i>The Experiment.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'><i>Triples and Doubles.</i> The Treble is the
<i>whole-hunt</i>, but never hunteth up farther
than the fourth place, for the four first
bells go <i>Doubles and Singles</i>; and every time
the Treble leads an <i>extream</i> is made in the
third and fourth places, according to the
common course of <i>doubles</i> and <i>singles</i> upon,
four bells; which course of <i>doubles</i> and <i>singles</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>must be continued, the two hind bells in the
mean time dodging, until the making of the
first <i>Parting</i> change, which will separate the
two hind bells; and then the four first bells go
the same course of <i>doubles</i> and <i>singles</i> again,
the two hind bells dodging as before, until the
making of the second <i>Parting</i> change, and so
successively. The <i>Parting</i> change is a <i>double</i>
change on the four middle bells, and made at
the leading of the Treble. The first <i>Parting</i>
change may be made either at the first second
or third leading of the <i>Treble</i>, observing,
that whatsoever bell in the first <i>Parting</i>
change moves down to the Treble, when the
Treble leads and that bell lieth next it again,
the second <i>Parting</i> change must then be
made. And whatsoever bell in the second
<i>Parting</i> change moves down to the Treble
when the Treble leads, and that bell lieth
next it again, the third <i>Parting</i> change must
then be made, and so successively. There being
five <i>Parting</i> changes in the Peal, and as
many <i>half-hunts</i>, each of the bells (the Treble
excepted) taking that place one after another;
and consequently, the five persons that
ring them must call the <i>Parting</i> changes one
after another as their turn comes, according
to the aforesaid rule.</p>

<p class='c006'>Each of these two peals by the method

or any other at pleasure. The <i>Parting</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>change is a <i>double</i> on the four middlemost of

<p class='c006'>’Tis plainly demonstrable, that the<a id='t168'></a> <i>Principle</i>

part; or 1260, which is a fourth part of the

And then by making of four <i>extreams</i>

<p class='c006'>Great variety of peals may be prickt upon

seldom practised, I will therefore forbear to
wast more paper in pricking down examples,
and proceed to the changes on <i>eight</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c015'><i>Changes upon Eight Bells.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c021'><i>Sixscores</i> upon <i>five</i> bells are commonly
rung upon <i>eight</i>, three bells lying behind.
The most musical to lie behind are 218,
418, 148, 248, 348, 468, 648, 548,
864, 241, 321, and 135 to be laid behind,
and then 1 and 3 to dodg throughout
the peal. And also 184 to be laid behind,
and to go the six changes thus, 814. 841.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>481. 418. 148. 184. 814. &#38;c. and so on
to the end of the <i>sixscore</i>. They may go the
<i>sixes</i> either at whole or half-pulls. Peals
upon <i>six</i>, as <i>Triples</i> and <i>Doubles</i>, <i>&#38;c.</i> make
exceeding good musick upon <i>Eight</i>, 48. 68.
41. or 18. lying behind. Or else <i>Triples</i> and
<i>doubles</i> upon the six middle bells, the Treble
leading, and the Tenor lying behind. And also
<i>Triples</i> upon <i>seven</i>, the Tenor lying behind.
But for such as have not yet attain’d
the skill to ring these compleat peals, <i>Sett-changes</i>
are very proper for them, being easie
and rung with little difficulty.</p>

<h4 class='c019'><i>Colledge Grounds.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'>The <i>grounds</i> of these <i>sett-changes</i> are of
two kinds. First, placing of the bells
<i>Fifths</i>, or secondly <i>Thirds</i>. To place them
<i>fifths</i>; the 4 must hunt up behind the 7, the
3 behind the 6, and the 2 behind the 5. Or
else the 5 may hunt down under the 2, the 6
under 3, and the 7 under 4. Or otherwise,
first a <i>single</i>, then a <i>double</i>, and then a <i>triple</i>
change to be made on the middlemost bells,
all which are to one effect; for then the bells
will lie <i>fifths</i> thus, 15. 26. 37. 48. Here are
four <i>Concords</i> to be chiefly regarded in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>peal. The first is 15. the second 26. the third
37. and the fourth is 48. These four <i>Concords</i>
may go the methods of any changes upon
four bells; 1.5 being taken for the Treble,
2.6 for the Second, 3.7 for the Third, and
4.8 for the Fourth; and the <i>Concords</i> to
change places with each other at pleasure.
Wherein ’tis observable, that the two notes
of every <i>Concord</i> must constantly attend each
other in their motion; that is, whensoever
one of the two notes moves, the other must
follow it. For example: admit they were
to go the <i>twenty four</i> changes, and that 1.5
were to hunt up over 2.6, 3.7, and 4.8. first
therefore it must move up over 2.6, wherein
it makes four changes: for first, the 5 moves
up over the 2 thus, 12563748, the 1 must
follow it thus, 2156.37.48.   Then the 5
moves up over 6. 2165.37.48. the 1 follows
it again 26.15.37.48; here the two <i>Concords</i>
have made a change. In which manner
also 1.5 must move up over 3.7. and 4.8. And
in this manner are the <i>Concords</i> to move and
change places with each other throughout
the peal. Or secondly, to place the bells
<i>thirds</i>, the 64 and 2 must hunt up, or else the
357 down; or otherwise a <i>triple</i>, a <i>double</i>,
and a <i>single</i> change to be made on  the middlemost
bells; all which are to one and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>same effect, for then the bells will lie <i>thirds</i>
thus, 13.57.24.68. Here are also four <i>Concords</i>
principally to be regarded in the peal:
the first is 1.3, the second 5.7, the third 2.4,
and the fourth 6.8. These four <i>Concords</i>
may also go the methods of any changes upon
four bells, 1.3 being taken for the <i>treble</i>,
5.7 for <i>second</i>, 2.4 for the <i>third</i>, and 6.8
for the <i>fourth</i>, and they must move in the
same manner as before I have shewed. By
these <i>Grounds</i> great variety of excellent and
Musical changes are to be rung. If they go
the <i>twenty four</i>, then the peal will consist of
four times that number, that is, <i>ninety six</i>
changes. But they may go only the first
eight changes of the <i>twenty four</i>, and then
the peal will consist of <i>thirty two</i>. Or else
the first eight changes of a <i>twenty four</i> doubles
and Singles, which will consist of <i>forty eight</i>
if the double changes of the <i>twenty four</i> are
singled, otherwise but <i>thirty two</i> as before.
Any <i>Concord</i> may be made a <i>hunt</i> and to
move either up or down at the beginning:
so that these <i>Grounds</i> afford great diversity.
In the ringing of these <i>Sett-changes</i> the notes
will lie sometimes <i>fifths</i>, sometimes <i>thirds</i>, and
sometimes <i>thirds</i> and <i>fifths</i>, and then ’tis pleasant
Musick to <i>Clam</i> them, that is, the two
notes of each <i>Concord</i> to strike together; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>if they are <i>clam’d</i> true, the eight bells will
strike as if they were but four, but with far
greater harmony. They may <i>Clam</i> two or
three bouts, and then strike open as many,
and so alternately; or else they may <i>Clam</i>
one pull, open the next, and so on. To reduce
the notes of the <i>fifths</i> to their right places
again at the conclusion of the peal, either
234 must hunt down, or else 765 up; or
otherwise a <i>Triple double</i> and <i>single</i> change to
be made on the middlemost bells, all which
are to one effect, and will bring the bells
round. To reduce the <i>thirds</i> either move
down 246 into their places, or else move up
753 into theirs; or otherwise make <i>single</i>,
<i>double</i>, and <i>triple</i> change on the middlemost
bells; all which are to one effect, and will
bring the bells again round.</p>

<p class='c005'>The methods of all peals upon <i>six</i> bells
may be prickt upon <i>eight</i>, observing but proportion
in the changes, according to the difference
in the number of bells, <i>viz.</i> <i>Triples</i>
and <i>doubles</i> upon <i>six</i> must be <i>quadruples</i> and
<i>triples</i> upon <i>eight</i>. <i>Doubles</i> upon <i>six</i> must be
<i>Triples</i> upon <i>eight</i>, <i>&#38;c.</i></p>

<p class='c006'>The method of ringing this peal is the

with this only difference. Every time
the <i>whole-hunt</i> leads, the <i>triple</i> change is here
made on the six middle bells, which parts the
two hind-bells, and so introduceth them by
degrees into the body of the peal. By this
method it will go 112, and by making of <i>bobs</i>
it will go 224, 336, or 672. The <i>bob</i> is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span><i>triple</i> change at the leading
of the Treble,
wherein the bell in the
<i>6th</i> place lieth still. The
warning for the <i>bobs</i> in

that in the 160 next before.
In the 336 ’tis the

same with that in the 480 next before. 2 may
be the <i>half-hunt</i> and 5 the <i>quarter-hunt</i>, or others
at pleasure.</p>

<h4 class='c019'><i>The Grand Experiment.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'><i>Quadruples and Triples.</i> The Treble is
the <i>whole-hunt</i>, but never hunteth up
farther than the sixth place; for the six first
bells go <i>triples</i> and <i>doubles</i>, it matters not of
what sort, provided that the <i>double</i> changes
at the leadings of the Treble are always made
on the four hindmost of the six bells; which
course of <i>triples</i> and <i>doubles</i> must be continued,
the two hindmost of the eight bells in the
mean time dodging until the first <i>Parting</i>
change is made, which will separate the two
hindmost bells; and then the six first bells go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>the same course of <i>triples</i> and <i>doubles</i> again, the
two hindmost bells in the mean time dodging
as before, until the second <i>Parting</i> change is
made, and so successively. The <i>Parting</i> change
is a <i>triple</i> change on the six middle bells,
and made at the leadings of the <i>whole-hunt</i>.
The first <i>Parting</i> change may be made either
at the first second third fourth or fifth leading
of the Treble; observing, that whatsoever
bell in the first <i>Parting</i> change moves
down to the Treble, when the Treble leads
and that bell lieth next it again, the second
<i>Parting</i> change must then be made. And again,
whatsoever bell in the second <i>Parting</i>
change moves down to the Treble, when the
Treble leads and that bell lieth next it again,
the third <i>Parting</i> change must then be made,
and so successively; there being seven <i>Parting</i>
changes in the peal, and as many <i>half-hunts</i>,
each of the <i>seven</i> bells taking that place
one after another. So that the seven persons
that ring the <i>2d</i>, <i>3d</i>, <i>4th</i>, <i>5th</i>, <i>6th</i>, and
<i>7th</i> bells, must call the <i>Parting</i> changes one
after another, according as the aforesaid rule
directs them: or else he that rings the Treble
may do it, but not so well as the rest. To ring it
with such peals upon six bells which consist of
single courses, it will go 420; with double
courses 840. This peal may also be rung <i>triples</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>that is, the six first bells to go <i>doubles</i>, the two
hind bells in the mean time dodging, and the
<i>Parting</i> changes to be made as before. But
in ringing it with such Peals of <i>Triples</i> and
<i>Doubles</i>, or else <i>Doubles</i> upon six bells, where
the <i>double</i> change at every leading of the Treble
is made in the <i>2d</i> <i>3d</i> <i>5th</i> and <i>6th</i> places,
there, whatsoever two bells lie next the Treble
at the first <i>Parting</i> change, the same two
bells will lie next it at every <i>Parting</i> change,
which will be a rule for calling them, there
being only five <i>Parting</i> changes in it, which
are <i>triples</i> as before. The first <i>Parting</i> change
may also here be made either the first second
third fourth or fifth time the Treble
leads. If it is rung with peals upon <i>six</i> bells,
consisting of single Courses, it will then go
300, with double Courses 600. This peal
may also be rung by <i>Concatenating</i> of divers
kinds of methods. For as the peal consists of
several parts, <i>viz.</i> from one <i>Parting</i> change to
the next, being accounted a compleat part;
so each part may be rung by a different method
from the rest. For any peals upon six
bells, whether <i>doubles</i>, or <i>triples and doubles</i>,
consisting either of single or double Courses,
may indifferently be rung together in this
peal, succeeding<a id='a181'></a> each other in the several
parts of it, and at every <i>Parting</i> change a new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>method to begin. Or else any two of them
to succeed each other alternately throughout
the parts of the peal, or more or less at
pleasure. But still observing, that all that
are rung together in one peal must be such,
where the <i>doubles</i> at the leadings of the Treble
are made on the four hindmost of the six
bells; or else all of them such, where the <i>doubles</i>
at the leadings of the Treble are made in
the second and third, and the fifth and sixth
places. If they are of the first kind, then
there will be seven <i>Parting</i> changes in the
peal, and as many <i>half-hunts</i>; and the <i>half-hunts</i>
must successively call the <i>Parting</i> changes
as before I have shewed: if of the later
kind, then but five <i>Parting</i> changes, which
must be call’d by the same rule as before I
have shewed in ringing it with one peal of
this kind. And also observing, if the first
<i>Parting</i> change is made at the first second
third or fourth leading of the Treble, then
whatsoever method it goes at first, it must also
go the same again after the last <i>Parting</i>
change is made. But in ringing it with peals
of the first kind, the second being made the
first <i>half-hunt</i>, and to call the first <i>Parting</i>
change; and with peals of the later,<a id='t182'></a> the <i>3d</i>
likewise: then the last <i>Parting</i> change in either
of them will conclude the peal.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>This peal may go the method of the <i>Experiment</i>
upon <i>six</i> bells, <i>page <a href='#Page_162'>162</a></i>, that is, the
four first bells to go the <i>Twenty four</i> Doubles
and Singles as in that peal; and the four
hindmost bells in the mean time to dodg double.
The <i>Parting</i> changes are <i>triples</i> on the
middle bells, and the same rules observed in
making and calling them, as in that peal: but
here are seven of them in this, and 168 changes.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <i>Experiment</i> upon <i>six</i> may also be rung
<i>Comprehensively</i> herein. The six first bells to
go that compleat peal, the two hindmost of
the eight bells in the mean time dodging;
and every time the <i>3d</i> bell comes to call the
<i>Parting</i> change on six, then instead of it a
<i>Grand</i> change must be made, that is, a <i>triple</i>
on the six middle bells: and then the six first
bells to go the compleat peal again, the two
hindmost bells in the mean time dodging as
before, untill the third bell calls another
<i>Grand</i> change, and so successively; there being
three of them in the peal, and 360 changes.
If the bells are placed 23567148 at
the beginning, the 4.8 will dodg behind the
first <i>sixscore</i> of it, 4.1 the second, and 1.8 the
third, and then the <i>5th</i> may call the <i>Grand</i>
changes in the place of the <i>3d</i>; or any other
three bells may be laid behind at first, for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>sake of Musical dodging. The first <i>Grand</i>
change may be made either at the first second
third fourth or fifth <i>Parting</i> change, observing,
that whatsoever bell at the first <i>Grand</i>
change should then in course have call’d a
<i>Parting</i> change, every time that bell comes to
call a <i>Parting</i> change, it must call a <i>Grand</i>
change in the place of it: or else any one of
the six first bells (the <i>whole-hunt</i> excepted)
may be appointed beforehand to attend the
calling of the <i>Grand</i> changes, observing, that
every time that bell comes to call a <i>Parting</i>
change, a <i>Grand</i> change must be call’d in the
place of it.</p>

<h4 class='c019'><i>Imperial Bob.</i></h4>

<p class='c016'><i>Quadruples and Triples.</i> The Treble
hath a dodging course. The two first
and two last bells always dodg until the Treble
hindreth them, and in the mean time the
two next bells to those dodging bells do lie
still one change, dodg the next, and so by
turns until the Treble also hindreth them.
And the two bells in the fifth and sixth places
whilst the Treble is behind, and those in the
<i>3d</i> and <i>4th</i> places when ’tis before dodg, until
Treble likewise hindreth them. By this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>method it will go 224, and by making of
<i>bobs</i> it will go 448, 672, or 1344. The <i>bob</i>
is a <i>triple</i> change at the leading of the Treble,
wherein the bell in the fourth place lieth
still.</p>

respects with <i>Oxford double Bob</i> before,
excepting the <i>bobs</i> in this peal, which are
made instead of the <i>singles</i> in that. The <i>bobs</i>
are here made in the same manner, and call’d
by the same rule in the 180 and 360, as in

<p class='c006'>The Treble is the <i>whole-hunt</i>,
and hath a dodging course.
When it leaves the two hind bells,
they dodg until it leads, and then a
<i>double</i> is made on the four middle
bells, which parts the two hind bells;
but then the two hind bells dodg again
until the Treble displaceth
them. Every bell leads twice (except
when the Treble dodgeth
there) and as they hunt up and down
do make a dodg in the third and <i>4th</i>
places. When the Treble moves up
from dodging before, the bell that
dodged there with it continues in
the first and <i>2d</i> places, lying twice
together in each, until the Treble
comes down to dodg there with it
again. By this method it will go
120, and by making of <i>bobs</i> it will
go 360. At the <i>bobs</i> the bell in the
fourth place lieth still. The warning
for them is this, When the <i>half-hunt</i>
leads, and the Treble moves
down, and dodgeth there with it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>a <i>bob</i> must then be made at that leading of the
Treble. The 3 may be the <i>half-hunt</i>, or any
other.</p>

bell leads twice, and then moves up
into the third place where it lieth
twice,  and then moves down again
except the motion of the Treble hindreth.
When the Treble goeth to
lead and leaves leading, the <i>double</i> is
on the two first and two last bells;

<h3 class='c015'><i>Grandsire upon Symphonie. 1. 2. and 6.</i></h3>

<p class='c016'>This peal of <i>Symphonie</i> may be rang with
but two single or two treble changes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>at the end of either <i>Eighteenscore</i>, by ringing
it with single and double <i>bobs</i> as in <i>Grandsire
Bob</i>. The rule for calling the <i>bobs</i> in this
peal is the very same as in <i>Grandsire Bob</i>, but
when the <i>bob</i>-changes are to be made, the
Hunts do not lie in the same order as in
<i>Grandsire Bob</i>; for in this peal at a single
<i>bob</i> the <i>whole-hunt</i> leads, the <i>half-hunt</i> in the
<i>5th</i> place, and the <i>quarter-hunt</i> in the <i>4th</i>
place. And at the first <i>bob</i> of a double <i>bob</i>
the <i>half-hunt</i>is in Tenor’s place, and <i>quarter-hunt</i>
in <i>2ds</i> place; and at the later <i>bob</i> the
<i>half-hunt</i> is in the <i>5th</i> place, and <i>quarter-hunt</i>
in <i>2ds</i> place, just contrary to what it is in
<i>Grandsire Bob</i>. I have prickt this peal with
two Treble changes in every twelve; so
that if you make two Trebles more at the end
of either <i>Eighteenscore</i> (which must be made
when the <i>whole-hunt</i> is going to lead just two
changes sooner than if you should have made
a <i>single</i>) there will then be in the whole 720
just Sixscore and two Treble changes.</p>

<p class='c006'>This peal may be rang by hunting the

from it only in this;
when it is 1——5 behind in the
hunting of the Treble, the

1——5 before, in the hunting of
the Tenor the bells behind
dodg till Treble parts them:
